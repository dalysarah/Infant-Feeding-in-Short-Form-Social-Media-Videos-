Here I am. I'm going to show you what it's like to pump for a whole day using the mom cozy M5. This is my actual first pump of the day. I really love these pumps. They're quiet, discreet, hold up to like 6, 7 ounces of milk if you're careful. The molds are amazing and the whole design of it is pretty, pretty dope. I think I made like 11 oun pretty good. These containers are from Cradle Plus. I love them. They come in 33 size containers, 33 ounce size containers and 16 ounce containers. And it comes with stickers to decorate. This is my second pump of the day. She will literally rock herself on to let me know that she wants me to pat her butt and rock her to sleep. Love it. Here, dude. Wake up. Every time I stop. I'm just so cute. Isn't she so cute? You got baby fever. I got baby fever too. I want another one. I know I'm crazy. I know I'm crazy. Okay, don't judge me. But I can.

Okay, good night. Good night. Okay, I am doing my last month of the night here. Just a little posy posy for you. I was feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself.

It was really hard leaving my baby. But you gotta do what you gotta do. This life sucks. But I'm working at three or four different middle schools, so I had to invest in some wearable pumps because I do not want to be pumping in, like, the teachers lounge or anything like that and somebody walk in and, like, you know, I don't want to be asking for a room, like being doing too much. So just come to my car pump. And it does have a timer thing, so that works perfect. But let's see how many ounces we get in today's pump. My last pump was at 7am It's 10:20pm so we'll see.

I'm gonna start trying to do it more. But I am nursing also, so I don't want to overly pump, if that makes sense. I don't even know if that's a thing. But what I do is I put it in this bottle first or a different bottle that has a sealable lid, you know, and then I pour that in. Let's see. And again, not that much, but I will pump later and then also show, I guess, my progression throughout the day. I'm gonna let this get cold and then combine it with this.

She is a week old today, so. Yeah. I also see why they call it liquid gold. Because this is more milky than it was. It was way. It was even more yellow than this, but good stuff."

I'm a mom to two under two and after 11 and a half weeks with my baby, I am going back to work in foster care. I Woke up at 4am and started by pumping and then I packed some breast milk to send with my baby because they're going to my parents house today. So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How do you store your milk? I had no idea. Nobody ever sat me down and said, hey, this is how you store the milk. You can't mix hot with cold. It has the room temperature. How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that. I still remember the very first mama that followed me on here and that is Casey Baby. So Casey Baby, thank you so much for following me. You were the first one and yeah, you incorporated me into this wonderful community of mothers. So shout out to you and thank you to everybody else. Hope you all have a great day and enjoy this life.

Right here I got definitely about 9 ounces. Yeah. So I just go into an empty room or an area and I just pump. Right here, I'm at my second pump of the night. I think this is around 2 in the morning.

This one wasn't as much as the first one. I probably got about somewhere between 5 and 6 ounces from the second pump. And after this, I got one more pump left, and then I'll be ready to go home.

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

This is just how we make our bottles. #formulafeedinghacks #nubyrapidcool #babybottles #mumhacks #prematurebaby #cmpa  How I make my baby's bottles using the Noobie Rapid Core. I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution.

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."

The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."
life.withjayde-5170-519,https://www.tiktok.com/@life.withjayde/video/7237460809473887531,Is the text defending formula feeding?," Hi guys. So I am still sick. The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

chaoticmadre2-691-212,https://www.tiktok.com/@chaoticmadre2/video/7294698773542980907,Is the text defending formula feeding?," Good morning, y'all. Happy Friday. This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it.

It was really hard leaving my baby. But you gotta do what you gotta do. This life sucks. But I'm working at three or four different middle schools, so I had to invest in some wearable pumps because I do not want to be pumping in, like, the teachers lounge or anything like that and somebody walk in and, like, you know, I don't want to be asking for a room, like being doing too much. So just come to my car pump. And it does have a timer thing, so that works perfect. But let's see how many ounces we get in today's pump. My last pump was at 7am It's 10:20pm so we'll see. So this is what we're working with. Let's see if it fits all in here. So let's do it. I'm gonna have to stop this, and then I'll come back to show you how much I did. This one we made."

I'm a mom to two under two and after 11 and a half weeks with my baby, I am going back to work in foster care. I Woke up at 4am and started by pumping and then I packed some breast milk to send with my baby because they're going to my parents house today. So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that. I still remember the very first mama that followed me on here and that is Casey Baby. So Casey Baby, thank you so much for following me.

Right here I got definitely about 9 ounces. Yeah. So I just go into an empty room or an area and I just pump. Right here, I'm at my second pump of the night. I think this is around 2 in the morning. And if you don't know, between 1 and 4am you will get the most milk if you just get up and pump. But luckily I was already up third shift, so it was no problem. This one wasn't as much as the first one. I probably got about somewhere between 5 and 6 ounces from the second pump. And after this, I got one more pump left, and then I'll be ready to go home. Y'all hear her? Hey, Dolly. Abigail. Oh. So right here, I think I probably got four ounces, four and a half ounces from this pump. And then now I'm at home and I'm just showing you everything that I pumped. I'm gonna put it in the jar and go about my day. You got your."

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

This is just how we make our bottles. #formulafeedinghacks #nubyrapidcool #babybottles #mumhacks #prematurebaby #cmpa  How I make my baby's bottles using the Noobie Rapid Core. I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution. So please, I would really, really appreciate it."

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."

The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."

So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

chaoticmadre2-691-212,https://www.tiktok.com/@chaoticmadre2/video/7294698773542980907,What is the tone of the text?," Good morning, y'all. Happy Friday. This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

Normally I just throw the pump over my shoulder while I'm like, getting everything together. And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers.

I told myself I was gonna try to film some, like, nursing slash breastfeeding videos. So I guess this is me showing just a little bit of my process. My process. But this is milk that I pumped over the night and went ahead and put in the fridge. It is only about like 3 and some ounces. And then this is what I just pumped at 2:15. I'm gonna start trying to do it more. But I am nursing also, so I don't want to overly pump, if that makes sense. I don't even know if that's a thing. But what I do is I put it in this bottle first or a different bottle that has a sealable lid, you know, and then I pour that in. Let's see. And again, not that much, but I will pump later and then also show, I guess, my progression throughout the day. I'm gonna let this get cold and then combine it with this. Because this just came out of the fridge. I just brought it for show. And then I'm going to bag some of it because I put them in about four ounce baggies and I have about three of those. She is a week old today, so. Yeah. I also see why they call it liquid gold. Because this is more milky than it was. It was way. It was even more yellow than this, but good stuff."

I'm a mom to two under two and after 11 and a half weeks with my baby, I am going back to work in foster care. I Woke up at 4am and started by pumping and then I packed some breast milk to send with my baby because they're going to my parents house today. So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How do you store your milk? I had no idea. Nobody ever sat me down and said, hey, this is how you store the milk. You can't mix hot with cold. It has the room temperature. How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that. I still remember the very first mama that followed me on here and that is Casey Baby. So Casey Baby, thank you so much for following me.

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

And then we didn't wind up using any extra ounces yesterday. We did the day before, so I'm still gonna do it today. I used 2 ounces of it for a milk bath. He has a little bit of a rash on his cheeks, so he did that in the bath last night. So I'm still gonna do that again today.

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution. So please, I would really, really appreciate it."

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."
theformulafairy-2532-174,https://www.tiktok.com/@theformulafairy/video/7166363757453643050,Is the text implying that breastfeeding is superior to formula feeding?,"Per the CDC, sanitizing feeding items daily is recommended for babies who are premature, immunocompromised or under 2 months of age. The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."

The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

So here I am just putting my LV Stride pumps together super quick, throwing a towel down to make sure everything's clean. Ish. Normally I just throw the pump over my shoulder while I'm like, getting everything together. And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

And I thought maybe it was just because the suction of the pumps. Going from breastfeeding all the time to using pumps all the time. I thought maybe it was just feeling bruised because of that. But that's like, clearly a clock tucked. So last night it was getting really bad. And I text my friend that's a lactation with Ulta, and she's like, you need do the hawker trick. So I put some Epsom salt in a Hawka and let that soak for a minute. It's been like 24 hours now, and I. The pump's not getting it out, so I forgot my hand pump at home, and I think that might be a good way to get it out.

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

Label bag with month, year, and number bag #secondtimemom #onemonthold #breastmilkstorage #breastmilkhack #breastmilkbag #breastmilktiktok #breastfeeding #pumpingmom #newbornbaby #exclusivepumping #nursingmom  Breast Milk Storage Tips from a Second Time Mom First I like to label the bottles in the fridge with the date that it was pumped so that I remember when to freeze it. I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

Then I will start making the bottles for the triplets to get us through the night and half the day tomorrow. I get so many questions about how I'm mixing formula with my breast milk. Essentially, it's just a half a teaspoon per every 3 ounces of breast milk. Now, this is just something that our pediatrician has us doing because our babies were premature. So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it. If I have enough today, wonderful. If I don't tomorrow, that's okay too. Lift each other up as mamas fed as best. It really doesn't matter. Thank you guys for watching. I hope you have a great day."

But what I do is I put it in this bottle first or a different bottle that has a sealable lid, you know, and then I pour that in. Let's see. And again, not that much, but I will pump later and then also show, I guess, my progression throughout the day. I'm gonna let this get cold and then combine it with this. Because this just came out of the fridge. I just brought it for show. And then I'm going to bag some of it because I put them in about four ounce baggies and I have about three of those. She is a week old today, so. Yeah. I also see why they call it liquid gold. Because this is more milky than it was. It was way. It was even more yellow than this, but good stuff."

I'm a mom to two under two and after 11 and a half weeks with my baby, I am going back to work in foster care. I Woke up at 4am and started by pumping and then I packed some breast milk to send with my baby because they're going to my parents house today. So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How do you store your milk? I had no idea. Nobody ever sat me down and said, hey, this is how you store the milk. You can't mix hot with cold. It has the room temperature. How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that.

But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

And then we didn't wind up using any extra ounces yesterday. We did the day before, so I'm still gonna do it today. I used 2 ounces of it for a milk bath. He has a little bit of a rash on his cheeks, so he did that in the bath last night. So I'm still gonna do that again today.

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution. So please, I would really, really appreciate it."

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."

The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."
life.withjayde-5170-519,https://www.tiktok.com/@life.withjayde/video/7237460809473887531,Is the text promoting personal choice regarding infant feeding practices?," Hi guys. So I am still sick. The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

So here I am just putting my LV Stride pumps together super quick, throwing a towel down to make sure everything's clean. Ish. Normally I just throw the pump over my shoulder while I'm like, getting everything together. And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

And I thought maybe it was just because the suction of the pumps. Going from breastfeeding all the time to using pumps all the time. I thought maybe it was just feeling bruised because of that. But that's like, clearly a clock tucked. So last night it was getting really bad. And I text my friend that's a lactation with Ulta, and she's like, you need do the hawker trick. So I put some Epsom salt in a Hawka and let that soak for a minute. It's been like 24 hours now, and I. The pump's not getting it out, so I forgot my hand pump at home, and I think that might be a good way to get it out.

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

Label bag with month, year, and number bag #secondtimemom #onemonthold #breastmilkstorage #breastmilkhack #breastmilkbag #breastmilktiktok #breastfeeding #pumpingmom #newbornbaby #exclusivepumping #nursingmom  Breast Milk Storage Tips from a Second Time Mom First I like to label the bottles in the fridge with the date that it was pumped so that I remember when to freeze it. I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

Essentially, it's just a half a teaspoon per every 3 ounces of breast milk. Now, this is just something that our pediatrician has us doing because our babies were premature. So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it.

I'm a mom to two under two and after 11 and a half weeks with my baby, I am going back to work in foster care. I Woke up at 4am and started by pumping and then I packed some breast milk to send with my baby because they're going to my parents house today. So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How do you store your milk? I had no idea. Nobody ever sat me down and said, hey, this is how you store the milk. You can't mix hot with cold. It has the room temperature. How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that. I still remember the very first mama that followed me on here and that is Casey Baby. So Casey Baby, thank you so much for following me.

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution. So please, I would really, really appreciate it."

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."
theformulafairy-2532-174,https://www.tiktok.com/@theformulafairy/video/7166363757453643050,Is the text offering ways to save time?,"Per the CDC, sanitizing feeding items daily is recommended for babies who are premature, immunocompromised or under 2 months of age. The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."
life.withjayde-5170-519,https://www.tiktok.com/@life.withjayde/video/7237460809473887531,Is the text offering ways to save time?," Hi guys. So I am still sick. The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

chaoticmadre2-691-212,https://www.tiktok.com/@chaoticmadre2/video/7294698773542980907,Is the text offering ways to save time?," Good morning, y'all. Happy Friday. This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

So here I am just putting my LV Stride pumps together super quick, throwing a towel down to make sure everything's clean. Ish. Normally I just throw the pump over my shoulder while I'm like, getting everything together. And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

This is how much I got out of this one side, and normally it's about the same. And I have been having so much pain. Like yesterday it kind of started getting really painful. And I thought maybe it was just because the suction of the pumps. Going from breastfeeding all the time to using pumps all the time. I thought maybe it was just feeling bruised because of that. But that's like, clearly a clock tucked. So last night it was getting really bad. And I text my friend that's a lactation with Ulta, and she's like, you need do the hawker trick. So I put some Epsom salt in a Hawka and let that soak for a minute. It's been like 24 hours now, and I. The pump's not getting it out, so I forgot my hand pump at home, and I think that might be a good way to get it out. And it's almost my lunch break, so I think I'm going to run to Target on my lunch break and buy a new hand pump and try to work on it.

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

Label bag with month, year, and number bag #secondtimemom #onemonthold #breastmilkstorage #breastmilkhack #breastmilkbag #breastmilktiktok #breastfeeding #pumpingmom #newbornbaby #exclusivepumping #nursingmom  Breast Milk Storage Tips from a Second Time Mom First I like to label the bottles in the fridge with the date that it was pumped so that I remember when to freeze it. I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

Essentially, it's just a half a teaspoon per every 3 ounces of breast milk. Now, this is just something that our pediatrician has us doing because our babies were premature. So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it. If I have enough today, wonderful. If I don't tomorrow, that's okay too. Lift each other up as mamas fed as best. It really doesn't matter. Thank you guys for watching. I hope you have a great day."

So then I fed him and we did some snuggles and playtime and then I helped my husband load them up in the car. So I put our baby in and he put our toddler in. You want mama to get in the car? Yeah, Mama has to go to work. Okay. But I'll see you as soon as you get home. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. You have a great day with Nana and papa, okay? After my husband left with our kids to take them to my parents house, I took a shower and got ready for the day. I ended up blow drying my hair and then I put some makeup on. I don't usually wear makeup, but I decided to today because I felt like I was gonna cry. It was really my first time being away from my baby. Honestly, I just didn't feel ready to be away from my baby. I was also off of work for about a month before my baby was born because of some pregnancy complications. So I've gotten to spend a lot of time toddler too. I was off of work all of June, July and August and now it's September 5th and I'm going back. I love my job and I obviously went to college to do this and I have years of experience. I work with my best friend and we have a great team, but I just don't want to leave my babies. So today was definitely a hard day. But here I am just shutting the door and heading to the car. Between fall decorations for my office and pumping supplies, I was bringing so much to work. So I'm going to pump on my way. But thanks for joining."

This is my 8am using my baby Buddha. This is my holy grail of saving my milk supply. It was a time when I was struggling for a couple months. I was only pumping maybe about 3 ounces, and I didn't understand why because I would get 5 ounces or more. But ever since I got the Baby Buddha, it's definitely increased my milk supply up to its regular amount again. So this is my left side. I think this one had about 9.4 or 5 ounces, I think. But yeah, this is an amazing breast pump. It's small, it's portable, it is a little bit louder than my mom cozy. But it's really not that bad. I use it all the time in public. This definitely put my mind at ease once I see my luxifier finally increasing again. So this is going to be my right side. He didn't wake up to eat for his last round, so there was a little bit more than usual. But he's been teething really bad and hasn't been eating as much, so it's kind of stressing me out about that. But I think in total, we got about 12 ounces this morning from our 8am pump. And yes, I do have a discount code you mamas can use for any Baby Buddha product. Use Reyes WL at checkout. Thanks for pumping with me."

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums. The main thing and the most important thing that I did to help my formula feeding transition was just being kind to myself and being kind to my baby. Knowing that we're going through a transition, things might be a little patchy for a couple of days or a week or two weeks while we both get used to it. But just knowing even if you choose to feed your baby this, you're still worthy and you are still doing the best for your baby and your baby is well cared for. Don't worry about what anybody else tells you. If it's the right decision for you, just go for it."

How do you store your milk? I had no idea. Nobody ever sat me down and said, hey, this is how you store the milk. You can't mix hot with cold. It has the room temperature. How many days it could be in the fridge? Nobody told me that. I had to learn for myself. Sure, I thought about it when I was pregnant. I'll learn. I'll learn. I didn't learn to the day I started even producing enough milk to keep it in the fridge. I am not an over supplier. I'm not an under supplier. I'm basically getting my baby fed. Do I wish I could produce more milk? Absolutely. Do I want to be an overproducer? No. That's a lot of work. Breastfeeding in itself is a lot of work. Like, you see so many moms that are like, over producers or you know, that they buy a second freezer because they have so much milk. I don't like that. Kind of makes me feel guilty in a sense. Like, damn, like I don't have a good milk supply in the freezer. I just feel like you always have mom guilt. Even though the baby is perfectly fine. There's something in the back of your head where you're just like, constantly have like this small mom guilt and it fucking sucks. And you0 are going through postpartum, girl."

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that.

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump. You know, I'm feeding him, but, I mean, pretty nice, right?"

First, I'm going to measure out how many ounces I'm going to give to my baby. I'm using my digital flask of boiling water and I'm going to be measuring about 6 ounces as that's how much my baby drinks at the moment. And you want to do this first as if you put the formula in first, then it won't be the correct amount of ounces. I'm then going to pour my water into the Noobie Rapid Cool and leave about 2 ounces into the bottle. I'm then going to give the noobie a really good shake and wait for it Yellow. This shows that it's activated. I've already measured my formula, so I'm going to put this into the hot shot and give it a good shake for about 10 seconds. Once that's done, I'm going to give the newbie another good shake just to make sure it's cooled down and check to see if it's gone green. Once it's gone green, that means the water is the right temperature and you can pour back into the bott. I'm then going to pop my lid back on, give it another good shake and that's your bottle done in less than two minutes."

So sometimes as moms, we are not sometimes, probably all the time. We're constantly in a rush. This morning especially, I was in a hurry and my dumb ass forgot at least three bottles to put my milk into after I get done pumping. And this is not to do it all the time, but if it's an emergency situation and you don't want to pump and dump and if you have a clean water bottle, okay, you can put your milk into the water bottle. This is almost 16. This is a 16.9 ounce bottle. Your girl was not trying to pump and dump all this. Okay? I work hard for my Milky. So if you're a first time mom and if you're going back to work, obviously, yes, you do your best to prepare. Make sure you have all your pump parts, your, you know, your cooler bag and your bottles to put your milk in. But things happen and life happens and that's okay. Again, this is just a little tip. So if you have a clean water bottle, you can stash the milk in the water bottle and then, you know, put it in the cooler bag, okay. Until you get home."

This is just how we make our bottles. #formulafeedinghacks #nubyrapidcool #babybottles #mumhacks #prematurebaby #cmpa  How I make my baby's bottles using the Noobie Rapid Core. I just want to start by saying this personally works for us. It may not work for you and your lifestyle or your baby, so do whatever suits you. Every morning I fill my flask up with hot boiling water. This bottle holds one litre. In this video, I'm making a six ounce bottle. You want to start by measuring out your water in your bottle first. Like I said, I was making 6 ounce, so I poured my water up to the 6 ounce mark. Now I do the hot shot method. So for this you need to have 10 milliliters per ounce of hot water to kill the bacteria in your formula. So I pour my water into my noobie replica, making sure I'm leaving 60ml of water in my bottle. I then add my formula to my bottle. You want to do the formula after because formula adds volume to your water. Once I've given that a mix, I wait a few minutes just to make sure my water has definitely come down to an appropriate temperature. You can check by tapping the lid. Once it goes green, that means the water is good to go and then I add it to my bottle. I also always like to double check with the back of my wrist that it's not too hot."

My pumps model three times a day, how they meant to dry quick enough overnight. It might just be my cold New Zealand house, but it's taking forever to dry and I'm just feeling a little bit lost about pumping at work and what is safe for me to pump. Like how clean those pumps seem to be for my daughter to be able to drink the milk from it. And I'm just feeling a little bit stressed. I have googled, but I can't seem to find, find like a, like a strong idea about what to do. I've seen multiple options, but then I see things where people are like, that's probably not the best idea. So I'm now a little bit confused. Is the fridge with a plastic bag an idea? Is like wipes an idea? Do you have some way of drying them in between use? I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed by pumping and going back to work. My daughter is gonna be six months old, so she's gonna need quite a bit of milk. So I'm just trying to make sense of how that pumping thing works. I have tried pumping at home and I'm doing it at the moment because I need to have milk for her, but I'm struggling to get my pumps clean between each use. Like I said, my house is taking forever to dry them. So what did people use? I'm kind of freaking out because he's a week and I need to have a solution. So please, I would really, really appreciate it."

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."
theformulafairy-2532-174,https://www.tiktok.com/@theformulafairy/video/7166363757453643050,Is the text promoting or advertising products or stores?,"Per the CDC, sanitizing feeding items daily is recommended for babies who are premature, immunocompromised or under 2 months of age. The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood  So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary."
life.withjayde-5170-519,https://www.tiktok.com/@life.withjayde/video/7237460809473887531,Is the text promoting or advertising products or stores?," Hi guys. So I am still sick. The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."

This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is very different when I'm at work, but this is what we do during the day. So I just pumped. This is how much I pumped. She will not eat this much. So what I'm going to do is this bottle was in the fridge, shake this up to get all the fat. And then I'm gonna pour this bottle into this pitcher. And my daughter usually eats about five and a half to six ounces per bottle. So I'm gonna pour the excess from into this container here. And then I will put this in the fridge to cool it down. If she has a bottle of milk that she doesn't finish, I put it in here and save it for bath milk, so those go back in the fridge. This will stay on the counter until she eats within four hours. If it's longer than four hours, I'll pour this into that bottle and cool it off and then put it in our pitcher. After a day or two, or whenever the pitcher is full, not longer than three days, then I bag it and freeze it."

So here I am just putting my LV Stride pumps together super quick, throwing a towel down to make sure everything's clean. Ish. Normally I just throw the pump over my shoulder while I'm like, getting everything together. And then I go ahead and attach the pump, put them in my shirt, make sure that my nipples are lining up with the pump, put that bad boy in, and ready to go. I turn it down to like, the two speed just to, like, stimulate. And then once it starts going after like a minute or two, I turn it up to like, high. I usually keep it high for like 20 to 30 minutes, just depending on, like, what type of service I'm doing. I think here I pumped for like 25 minutes, and I got like six and a half ounces. So here I am just disconnecting my pumps, adding them to a bag, and then once I'm finished pumping, I just put them right back into my gallon Ziploc bag. And then I put it in our little mini fridge so that it keeps my pumps cool so I don't have to clean them in between each pump, which is a super nice, easy hack. And that's it. Put it in the fridge, plug my pump back in."

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed. So good night."

To cut down on washing bottles I use the pitcher method. So I collect all of my milk into one big pitcher and once it's full I freeze it. My first tip is to use a bowl with hot water and soap. Doing this will help you avoid unwanted contamination especially if you have a dirty sink like I do. Tip number two is to wear gloves. Since I'm using super hot water it really dries out my hands so the gloves are a lifesaver. I found the best soap for me to wash my pump parts with is Blue dawn dish soap. It really just helps get them the cleanest. My third tip then is to use a vertical drying rack or any drying rack really. This one is from OXO and it just really saves space and it makes sure your pump parts air dry. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments."

One of the things I was really anxious about when it came to returning back to work was how was I going to navigate pumping in the office. And I'll be honest, now that I've done it so many times, there is really no reason to be anxious or scared about it. But it is weird. I mean, you're pumping in a new environment versus pumping in your own home. My office has two pumping rooms and basically I just get set up. Usually I'll kind of scroll through my phone. Today I had a nice lovely cookie, which was actually super good. I was like, really surprised if you can't tell my face. But I usually pump for 20 minutes. That's just where I feel empty. And I'm not an over producer by any means. This session I got 5 ounces, which I was. I was happy with myself. That's good for me. So once I'm done pumping, I put all of my milk in, like, my travel baby bottle. And then I have my cooler bag with ice packs. Once it's all loaded up, I also will just stick it in the fridge until I'm ready to go home for the day. Once I'm done pumping, I usually will actually wash my dishes. I do have breast pump wipes, which I do like when I'm in a pinch or I don't have a lot of time. But I'm personally just more comfortable with washing my dishes. I bring my own, like, dish scrubber as well as, like my own little drying rack. I kind of have my setup shown for you guys, but I wash all my dishes and then I use like a drying microfiber cloth that I also bring just to make sure they're all dry. I get my pumped reassembled and just make sure it's ready to go for my next pump session. But pumping at work is not anything to be scared about, so good luck."

The NHS website now says that we can keep bottles in the fridge for 24 hours and use them when we need them. This has been life changing for a mum of two under two. Harper Wren uses all of the same bottles. These are the Tommy Tippy anti colic ones so far. This morning she had a bottle in bed while we were still in bed. That kind of classes as last night. Then she had a ready made Atomil bottle this morning with the anti colic stuff that I'm about to show you here. And she's had a breastfeed as well. I expect that these four bottles will last us this afternoon, this evening and then for the night. Tonight, however, we've obviously got the option of adding in a breastfeed or adding in a ready made which we keep in the cupboard as well. We used to use the Tommy Tippy prep machine and Tommy Tippy UV sterilizer, that was with Hudson's bottles. However, both babies are refluxy and we just ended up feeling like it wasn't working for us. We've tried all sorts with both babies and for Harper Wren this is what works best. The way we choose to now sterilize our bottles is as follows. I will thoroughly wash the bottles with the bottle brush you can see behind me here and obviously a smaller one for the smaller parts of the bottles, one of those spindly brushes and I quickly rinse them and put them in cold water with a sterilizing tablet. Just the cheap ones from Tesco. Leave it for 15 minutes, drain that water and then fill it with fresh water just to rinse them thoroughly. We have a weaker kettle which boils the water to 100, then cools down to 70 and keeps at 70 for an hour. Ready to make the bottles whenever you need to. I let the bottles cool down with the lids not quite on properly and then after this next bit I'll put them in the fridge. Set a two hour timer cook called Put bottles in fridge. Put bottles in fridge timer two hours starting now."

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge. Fingers crossed that Eloise gives me another good night."

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies."

We have like a two story building and the upstairs has like some like private rooms. So I'll go up there and I sit and I pump. And today I got this is just under 3 ounces which is not that bad considering on Saturday I only pump twice and I'm supposed to pump four times a day. And then on Sunday I only pump twice which is just really bad of me. But I've just been feeling so, so lazy. It's not so much like my mental health that's suffering, it's just I'm so lazy. Like I just will be like sitting on the couch and I'm like I don't want to get up to pump. So anyway when I'm at work it's just easier to like go upstairs and like sit down. So I pumped this morning while I got ready for work which is always a good session. And then just now just under 3 ounces for both sides. I do one side at a time and I do about 1212 minutes on each side. And so yeah, I'm gonna bag this. Pumping is a journey for sure. But I'm really persistent to like keep combo feeding. You know, I get a lot of comments and people have said never quit on a hard day and I stand by that because you shouldn't quit on a hard day. I'm gonna bag this milk and then I usually just keep this mechanism in the fridge in between pumping sessions at work. And then for my second session of the day which is usually at 4pm, today will be at 5 cuz I was like a little bit late. I just pull it out so I don't like wash it in between or anything. But yeah. Hope you guys are having a good day. If you're a pumping mom, just keep going or don't. Nobody really cares. Have a good day."

Label bag with month, year, and number bag #secondtimemom #onemonthold #breastmilkstorage #breastmilkhack #breastmilkbag #breastmilktiktok #breastfeeding #pumpingmom #newbornbaby #exclusivepumping #nursingmom  Breast Milk Storage Tips from a Second Time Mom First I like to label the bottles in the fridge with the date that it was pumped so that I remember when to freeze it. I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped."

Lets try to empower and motivate other women to do what is best for their babies, and not what was best in your experience. Every baby, and every mama is different. #spontaneoustriplets #empower #fedisbest #breastfedbaby #pumpingmama #tripletpregnancy #makebottleswithme  Hey, mamas, it's that time again. Let's make bottles for my triplets off the milk I pumped today. First thing I'm going to do is clean off my countertop with all the clean bottle parts and put them where they belong. Then I will start making the bottles for the triplets to get us through the night and half the day tomorrow. I get so many questions about how I'm mixing formula with my breast milk. Essentially, it's just a half a teaspoon per every 3 ounces of breast milk. Now, this is just something that our pediatrician has us doing because our babies were premature. So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it. If I have enough today, wonderful. If I don't tomorrow, that's okay too. Lift each other up as mamas fed as best. It really doesn't matter. Thank you guys for watching. I hope you have a great day."

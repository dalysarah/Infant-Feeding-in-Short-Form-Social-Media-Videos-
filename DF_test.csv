Bag milk with me while I talk about maintaining my supply. So a lot of people ask me questions about how I became an oversupplier. Did I do anything specific to make myself become an oversupplier. And honestly, the answer to that is no. I followed a few small steps from the beginning that kind of helped me established this supply. And then for me, I thought about the weaning process at the beginning. So I knew I didn't want to be like a super over producer, but I knew I also wanted to have a large stash so that when I'm away from my daughter, she has milk for whoever is watching her. And God forbid anything was to happen to me where I'm in the hospital or unable to produce milk for her, she can still be on breast milk until she turns one. So right now, currently I have two deep freezers. One of them is completely full and the other one is already halfway full. About every four days I bag about 150 ounces of milk. So yeah, I have a pretty good oversupply. I also nurse my daughter throughout the day as I'm pumping and I pump four times a day. So what I do to maintain my supply or what I did was to establish my supply was I latched my daughter every time she wanted milk between 0 days and about 3 months. Anytime she wanted milk, I gave it to her. And this was very hard because at the beginning the nips are very, very, very, very, very sore. And that was no different with me. I actually considered not doing it and just pumping because pumping did not hurt, because I was educated this time and I had the right flange size and I, you know, I figured out which pump worked for me. So pumping was very easy this time around, whereas with my first child it wasn't. But in the beginning, I did latch my daughter. I pushed through the pain about six weeks, it's excited and her latch got a little better. So it wasn't that painful. Then I just eat. I eat what I want to eat. I don't eat anything specific. Oats and all of that. No, no, I don't do that. I just eat. Just make sure I eat different proteins, starches, all the things I just eat. I also stay on a strict pump schedule. Like if I miss a pump, I will power pump the next day just to make sure that my supply does not drop. But I pump four times a day, three times or like 8:00 in the morning, about noon, about 3:00pm and then I still pump overnight or in the middle of the night. I also drink a lot of water and body armor to stay hydrated and replace those electrolytes. And other than that, there wasn't anything specific that I did to create my supply. It's just about staying consistent with how you're pumping when you're pumping and making sure you're emptying yourself completely. And then, like I said, staying educated or getting educated on pumps and plan sizes and inserts and things like that also helps. But come back for more if you want more tips and tricks on how to maintain your supply.","Bag milk with me while i talk maintaining my supply! #moms #momtok #momsoftiktok #bagmilkwithme #maintainingyoursupply #milksupplytips #exclusivelypumping #pumpingmom #pumping #oversupply #milkstorage #powerpump #viral #viralvideo #contentcreator #fyp #foryou  What's up, y'all?

I picked up the basketball game all morning from 7 till 2:30, then I had to work at 3. This is just from pumping this morning at the basketball game. I don't think it's full to the top, but this is what's left from the milk I sent with my mom. This is from the pumps at work. I left that. So I just had to use my own little water bottle. This is my work water bottle. So I just left it in the fridge so it's cold. I didn't have an extra bottle. So this is how much I. I've pumped more. But I would say like eight more ounces more than this because I gave her two bottles from basketball tournament. But I have 28 ounces left. I'm gonna make the bottles for the morning with this and then just use. She has like two feedings at night, so I'm just gonna use two bottles of that and make like eight and then probably make a couple more in the morning. I like to have like seven for the day for her. So I just got off work, so I'm gonna make like eight bottles for tomorrow. Then I'm gonna pump. Then I'm gonna put baby to sleep and take a shower. And she slept for like three hours and she just woke up at like 6:45 for my mom. So she's gonna be up a while. So, yeah, I'm probably not gonna go to sleep till like 11. And it's 8:10 right now.

So I officially went back to work on Monday and it's been kind of hard. To be completely honest. I was not expecting that in the slightest, I should say. I mean, I don't know what I was expecting in general, but I am now going in between nursing and pumping. So I pump while I'm at work and then I nurse when I pick him up and nurse before he goes to bed. So I only get like two nursing sessions a day, which kind of sad considering how long we've been going before. So it's been an adjustment, but I am bagging my milk after. This is about like a day and a half, I would say this picture. So I'm just bagging it. I was bagging it every day, but I've been kind of going more to almost two days just because on dishes and I have three kids. So trying to find time to do that has been a challenge. So I am measuring out four ounce bottles and then putting them in bags and I'm kind of curious to see how much milk I've had in that short period of time. So typ. I'll pump right before I go and drop off my youngest at my mom's and then I will pump again shortly after I'm at work, usually around my first break of the day. And then I will pump around lunchtime and then I pump right before he gets dropped off. I'm trying to pump in around the same times that he's eating with my mom just to try to keep it at least lined up so I'm not like overly pumping. The only hard part is I'm not used to waking up at 5am and pumping. Ben and little guy is kind of getting a little fussy. He's slowly waking up here. So not quite used to that. And I just putting my littlest to bed or oldest to bed right now and it looks like I need to go check on that. So I'll be right back. So I ended up taking a break and not helping my little or oldest to get back to bed. But this all of that pitcher was 54.5 ounces. That's insane. I barely would fill that pitcher before when I was just nursing and using the hawk up. So it's definitely been a challenge with all the new dishes that I've been having to do. But I think this is awesome and I like anything we make in mama's baby's fed is best. But I'm very proud of myself. So so far I will keep you guys updated on how the working and pumping journey goes, but so far, so good.","Maternity leave is offically over and now its time to navigate pumping/ nursing ü•π #pumpingmom #fyp„Ç∑ #nursingmomsoftiktok #pitchermethod #milkstoragetips #momsoftiktok #momofthree #postpartum #foryoupage #fyp Hey.

Another day of prepping bottles. I normally do this at night. Yesterday I didn't, Today I didn't. I just. I've been tired. So I still have three left from what I did for today. Sorry. Or yesterday. I'm so blocked, so. But I always just prep 9. If you missed yesterday's video, the reason why is because I don't do them at the same time every single day. And so he only drinks eight bottles a day, but. And he doesn't always drink everything that I'm giving him, but sometimes he does. And that way, like, I'm not pressured to do it by a certain time because I'm out of bottles. So the nine just gives me a little bit of flexibility. So sometimes I do it a little less than 24 hours, sometimes I do it a little bit more. But regardless, it has 24 hours worth of pumps. I'm able to pump five times in a day. I used to do six. I mean, when he was first born, I was pumping every 3ish hours. Anytime he ate, I pumped. I had an exclusive pumper. He was not able to latch because I have too much breast tissue. And he was basically suffocating, trying to eat. So that is why we don't have contact breastfeeding in our meal plan, if you will. So, yes, that's us. My son is 15 weeks old. I thought he was 14 weeks for the last two weeks, clearly. So that's great. I went back to work about three weeks ago. Go. That's been a pretty big adjustment in my book. Not in the ways that I thought. Like, I miss him and all of that, but, like, managing everyone's suals. I live in the US and if you haven't heard, child care is a nightmare here. And we're on a billion wait lists for daycare, and you pay more than you pay for your house. And then if they're sick, they can't go. When he was born, I was on. I checked on two of the waitlists that, like, I'm most excited about. I was number 40 and number 100, meaning there was 39 people ahead of me on one of them and 99 people ahead of me on another. Wild. It's wild. So that's just been, like, harder than I was anticipating. Yes. So now we have our bottles all set. I'm gonna do another one because I work tomorrow, so I can't do this in the morning. I'm gonna have to do this again tonight. I'm not gonna be. I'm not gonna have as many bottles to do, obviously, because I'm doing this later in the day. So we'll see how many bottles I prep for the next 24 hours tonight. Yeah. Hi. My baby's just sitting here just talking. Well he probably thinks I'm talking. Let's be real. So here's the nine bottles and then I prep an extra five ounces just cuz here and there. Like I'll need an extra ounce or two sometimes, especially when he's been up a while before bedtime. I don't really like to feed to sleep, but he's going through a leap and a grisper at the same time and that's a mess. So sometimes he just needs a little extra. Anyways, bottles are prepped.

So usually she has been eating more, so I'm just gonna make six bottles. She doesn't usually drink two during the night anymore, but I always like to have two during for during the night just in case. And I definitely am a prep my bottles in advance type girly, because that's just what works best for us. And, yeah, so this week or the next four days looks a little bit different for me because my husband is out of town for work. So since we've had her, she will be 3 months old next week. Since we've had her, we have just been together almost every day. My husband and I were super fortunate in the fact that he was home with me for eight of the 10 weeks of my maternity leave. So being completely by myself is a completely new territory for me personally. And I think what's hard is that I'm back to work, too. So not only now am I working, which has been a really hard adjustment for me, But I'm solo parenting as well, so that is a lot. It makes me really appreciative that my husband is super involved, you know, with help helping with the baby. Like, he does so much. He navigates our nighttime routine. Oh, my gosh. I just missed the bottle. Party fell. That was a total party, though. If you don't think that I scooped that off the counter into the bottle, you're wrong. We don't waste things around here. What was I saying? So he helps me with art. This is a disaster now. This went downhill so fast. Please hold back. Clean this up. So he's super involved, which is great. And it obviously makes my life a thousand times easier because we just navigate everything together. And one thing that I've been facing, I can't. I'm running out of formula in this container, which is making it really hard to scoop. One thing that I've been facing a lot of mom guilts about is going back to work and feeling overstimulated, if I'm being honest. We have to open a new thing about formula. This is the formula that we use. We use the kendamill. We don't use the organic. We just use the regular infant formula. So, yeah, this other one is running out. I think I have three scoops in there. I need two more. Two more scoops. I also love that the scoop is on the top because I don't have to shove my fingers in to look for it. So I'm going to open this. Okay. Back to business. I'LL dump the other one in here in a second. This is much easier now that it's like not empty, but anyways. So just coming home after work and just feeling extremely overstimulated already from, you know, being high school teacher and then having your own child to take care of is definitely a lot. And I think I just feel guilty about that often because when I was home with her all the time, I obviously got tired. But the mom guilt is not as bad because I can't ever get these lids off here trying to dump what's left, this concealer container. The mom guilt isn't as bad because I was with her all day. So like when I put her down, I didn't, didn't feel guilty or anything. But now that I'm gone from, I don't know, 6:30 to 3:30, it's an extremely guilty feeling because I'm overstimulated after, you know, being at work all day. And then I come home and I obviously want to spend time with my baby, but I'm tired so that's really hard. If I'm being honest, I never thought the stay at home mom life would be for me. That wasn't what things were like when I grew up. My parents never stayed home, they worked. So when my husband and I started talking about me staying at home, it wasn't really something I entertained because I just didn't think that it would be something I'd want to do. I thought, I want to work, okay? So I just never entertained that idea until about, I don't know, a couple days before I went back to work and I started panicking and then realized that I just wasn't ready to go back to work. Realizing that I wasn't ready to go back to work was a really hard pill to swallow because the reality is that it just didn't matter whether I was ready to go back to work or not. I had to go back to work because I'm a teacher and it's the middle of the school year and I have a contract, so it really wasn't an option. Also, here's the bottles we use. We use the nano baby bottles we. So it wasn't really an option because middle school year, contract, all the things, but. And I just also, I don't even know where I was going with that. But going back to work made me realize that I needed to find out what was really going to feed me and what was going to be best for my family after the school year and just definitely has made me explore other options, but definitely was a hard adjustment. It's still extremely hard every single day. If you think I don't know how many days left to school there are until summer, you're wrong. Because I do know, because I already have a countdown. So I think it was hard. It's hard for me even still, to realize that I love my job and I love my students and. But I also am in a different season of life right now, and I think that's a hard pill to swallow. But yeah, that was, you know, my make bottles and chat with me. But I think just recognizing we're in new seasons of our life is extremely hard. And being the adjustment from not being a mother to being a mother woo wee. That that's an adjustment.","make nightime bottles w meü´∂üèª #momsoftiktok #babiesoftiktok #firsttimemom #workingmom #makebottleswithme  Make nighttime bottles with me and bottles for tomorrow while I'm at work.

What was I saying? So he helps me with art. This is a disaster now. This went downhill so fast. Please hold back. Clean this up. So he's super involved, which is great. And it obviously makes my life a thousand times easier because we just navigate everything together. And one thing that I've been facing, I can't. I'm running out of formula in this container, which is making it really hard to scoop. One thing that I've been facing a lot of mom guilts about is going back to work and feeling overstimulated, if I'm being honest. We have to open a new thing about formula. This is the formula that we use. We use the kendamill. We don't use the organic. We just use the regular infant formula. So, yeah, this other one is running out. I think I have three scoops in there. I need two more. Two more scoops. I also love that the scoop is on the top because I don't have to shove my fingers in to look for it. So I'm going to open this. Okay. Back to business. I'LL dump the other one in here in a second. This is much easier now that it's like not empty, but anyways. So just coming home after work and just feeling extremely overstimulated already from, you know, being high school teacher and then having your own child to take care of is definitely a lot. And I think I just feel guilty about that often because when I was home with her all the time, I obviously got tired. But the mom guilt is not as bad because I can't ever get these lids off here trying to dump what's left, this concealer container. The mom guilt isn't as bad because I was with her all day. So like when I put her down, I didn't, didn't feel guilty or anything. But now that I'm gone from, I don't know, 6:30 to 3:30, it's an extremely guilty feeling because I'm overstimulated after, you know, being at work all day. And then I come home and I obviously want to spend time with my baby, but I'm tired so that's really hard. If I'm being honest, I never thought the stay at home mom life would be for me. That wasn't what things were like when I grew up. My parents never stayed home, they worked. So when my husband and I started talking about me staying at home, it wasn't really something I entertained because I just didn't think that it would be something I'd want to do. I thought, I want to work, okay? So I just never entertained that idea until about, I don't know, a couple days before I went back to work and I started panicking and then realized that I just wasn't ready to go back to work. Realizing that I wasn't ready to go back to work was a really hard pill to swallow because the reality is that it just didn't matter whether I was ready to go back to work or not. I had to go back to work because I'm a teacher and it's the middle of the school year and I have a contract, so it really wasn't an option. Also, here's the bottles we use. We use the nano baby bottles we. So it wasn't really an option because middle school year, contract, all the things, but. And I just also, I don't even know where I was going with that. But going back to work made me realize that I needed to find out what was really going to feed me and what was going to be best for my family after the school year and just definitely has made me explore other options, but definitely was a hard adjustment. It's still extremely hard every single day. If you think I don't know how many days left to school there are until summer, you're wrong. Because I do know, because I already have a countdown. So I think it was hard. It's hard for me even still, to realize that I love my job and I love my students and. But I also am in a different season of life right now, and I think that's a hard pill to swallow. But yeah, that was, you know, my make bottles and chat with me. But I think just recognizing we're in new seasons of our life is extremely hard. And being the adjustment from not being a mother to being a mother woo wee. That that's an adjustment."

So again, I'm still learning this whole pitcher method thing, but what I do know is you do not mix cold and fresh expressed milk. So like for me, this is my pitcher that I use. These two was milk. So these two were milks that I expressed last night and the nighttime feedings and I just put them in the fridge in the bottle. I put them from my haaka into here. So now that they're both cold, I'm just gonna go ahead and pour them into my pitcher. And I just finished feeding my son right now. He ate, excuse my daughter, he ate off my left. So I had my haaka on my right side and I got all of this. Yeah. So now usually what I'll do is let me grab a bottle. So I'll grab just a clean bottle. Just because these already had milk in them and they're cold already. I'll grab just a regular, clean, room temperature water or bottle. Sorry. And I'll just kind of put my expressed milk, my freshly expressed milk in here. That was about 5 ounces. I usually leave it outside for a couple minutes and then I'll put it in the fridge and I'll let that get cold. And then in my next feed, feeding after I express that milk and I get some more in here, this one should be cold by then. I'll put this into the pitcher and then I'll put this into another fresh bottle and so on. I hope that makes sense. So no, you don't put freshly expressed milk in with cold milk. You let it get cold on its own. So like I'll go and I'll wash these and then they'll just be ready for my next feeding.

Let's talk about boosting milk supply. You see the things that I take to boost my supply, I boost the quantity and quality of my breast milk. But the main thing that increase your supply is pumping or giving your child as the baby demands. Because production of breast milk is about demand and supply. When we pump, we pump more frequently. Like every three hours or every four hours. We are demanding more milk from our body. So if we keep pumping, we demand and then the body will supply. So I've received many DMs saying my breast milk, my breast milk is low. My. My breast milk is low. How many times are you pumping? Someone says two times a day. It won't increase because you are telling your body that my baby only feeds two times a day. But if you are giving breast, you give baby on demand. Meaning your breast milk will regulate according to your child's demand. So to us who are pumping, we pump every three hours so our bodies can keep producing. Because we are not giving our babies breast. Like me, I don't give breast at all. I only pump. My son feeds whatever I have pumped. So if as long as you are not pumping enough, you are not removing milk, constantly removing milk from your breast, your supply will remain that way. If you are trying to build supply, at least pump every two hourly. Tell your body that baby needs more milk, Baby needs more milk. That way you will see your supply increasing. Like in like a week, you will see your supply increasing bit by bit. I had lot of milk, but I did not have this such milk. I built this supply by pumping. As long as you are still lazy to pump, you still think pumping is a lot of work. If you are exclusively pumping, then you won't have enough milk. If you are combination pumping and giving baby breasts, if you you give baby breast, get a haka. That way it helps to empty your breast fully. Get your haka. You feed baby from the other breast. You put haka on the other breast that the baby is not feeding on. And then whatever you get from the hacker, that way you can easily build your your freezer stash. Or you can easily put milk aside for days that you are not there. If you feel like pumping after feeding, you can still pump and build your supply like that. You can build your supply in many ways, but don't rely on the food, only pumping, removing demand and supply. My people, my mommies, I still say demand and supply. Pump continuously feed your babies. You will see your supply will go up. Don't come to my DM saying you your supply is low. While you are lazy to pump, we pump. If you're a pumping mother, be ready. Be ready to constantly pump. Whether you like it or you don't like it. I hope this video was clear. So mummies who exclusively pump. Pumping more frequently will help increase your supply.

To attach the label, just slip the rubber band onto the neck of the bag to save space in the freezer. Freeze your milk flat.

I didn't have like the fancy baby food maker, so I didn't have a steamer either. So we had to make a little homemade steamer. Got a full day of work and a full day of daycare. So. Gang stoppers. She has been sleeping well this past week. There was one day that was rough, and last night she didn't want to go to sleep, but when she did, she slept good through the night. Everyone says don't say that out loud or you'll jinx it, but she's never been a great sleeper as it is. It's. It's always a great surprise when she sleeps through the night for me.

I have to take a picture with her and Millie every month to see how much she grows. Compares, compares with Millie. And she is rolling over like it's nothing. Now, yesterday I made some homemade sweet potato puree and it's actually not as hard as you think to make homemade purees. I didn't have like the fancy baby food maker, so I didn't have a steamer either. So we had to make a little homemade steamer. Got a full day of work and a full day of daycare. So. Gang stoppers. She has been sleeping well this past week. There was one day that was rough, and last night she didn't want to go to sleep, but when she did, she slept good through the night. Everyone says don't say that out loud or you'll jinx it, but she's never been a great sleeper as it is. It's. It's always a great surprise when she sleeps through the night for me. So have a good day."

Controversial things we did as first time parents, we don't have a schedule. Hallie's always ate when she was hungry and slept when she was tired.

We co slept some nights in the newborn stage she slept between us and throughout the past year if she would wake up in the middle of the night, we would just bring her to bed with us. She doesn't have a bedtime. My husband and I are both working parents and so whenever we get home we only have a few hours with her and we just kind of follow her lead and her cues on when she is tired. Sometimes that's 7:30, sometimes that's 8:30, sometimes that's 9:30. I breastfeed in public, I pump in public and I don't care. We send our daughter to daycare and we're still good parents for some reason. It's like stay at home moms versus working moms on the Internet when that's not real life. So those are some of the things that we've done that are controversial according to the Internet. I'm curious what things you do that you think are kind of controversial.

Here is how you figure that out! #breastmilk #milkstorage #breastmilkstorage #breastmilktok #freezedried #homestead #homesteading #foodstorage #homesteadtoktok ,"The number one most asked question on my freeze drying breast milk videos is definitely how do you know how much water to add to your freeze dried breast milk powder in order to reconstitute it into a bottle? So I'm here to break that down for you a little bit. I'm currently on vacation, so I'm just going to explain it to you and when I get back, I can do a whole video showing you step by step how to really do this. This is kind of a loaded question. So the average is that every tablespoon of freeze dried breast milk powder will reconstitute in 2 ounces of water. Now that's just an average. However, I personally am comfortable using that average because my baby gets a bottle once or twice a month. So it really, if it is a little bit more watered down, it really doesn't make any difference to her. That's fine. However, there is a mathematical way that you can calculate exactly how much water to add to the breast milk powder. All you're doing is weighing your breast milk before it goes into the freeze dryer and then you're weighing it once it comes out. You're subtracting the weight, the powder, once it comes out of the freeze dryer from the starting weight. And then whatever that answer is, whatever you're left with, is how much water has been removed. So if you're starting with 100 grams of breast milk and then you have 30 grams of breast milk powder, you know that you removed 70 grams of water. But if you want to split that up and divide it into multiple bottles, which I'm sure is what you would want to do, you want to see how many tablespoons are in your batch of breast milk powder. Once you have that number, then you can divide that into the 70 grams of water or however much water got removed from the breast milk. So if your 30 grams of breast milk powder splits up into 10 tablespoons, then you would take your 70 grams of water that you removed, divide that by 10 because that's the amount of tablespoons that you have. And then you know that each tablespoon of breast milk powder would reconstitute with seven grams of water. Obviously those numbers are just made up, but that's just explaining the process on how you would do that.","The most asked question is how do you know how much water to add to your breastmilk powder in order to make a bottle.

First, let's talk about what is lipase. Lipase is an enzyme in your breast milk that helps your baby break down the nutrients. That enzyme remains active when you're refrigerating or freezing your breast milk. The longer that enzyme is active, the more soapy or metallic your breast milk is going to taste. However, once you freeze dry your breast milk, it stops the process of the lipase enzyme breaking down the breast milk. This will significantly reduce the amount of the enzyme in your breast milk, which will help with the taste dramatically. However, since freeze drying does maintain the nutritional value so well, it can't remove the lipase that's already in the breast milk, but it will stop it from continuing to grow.","A question i keep getting asked is how does freeze drying affect breastmilk with high lipase? #homesteading #homestead #homesteadtoktok #freezedried #breastmilk ##milkstorage##breastmilkstorage##breastmilktok##foodstorage Does freeze drying your breast milk help with high lipase in breast milk?

It's about 1245 where I live. So I want to talk about foremilk versus hindmilk and how you know if your baby's emptying your breast or if they're just getting that foremilk. So first, what's the difference between foremilk and hindmilk? Foremilk is the first letdown part of your milk supply that comes out. It's a little more watery. And your hind milk is the milk that's behind that. It typically has a higher fat content than 4 milk. So if baby is not emptying your breasts all the way, you will notice this in their diapers. And this is something my pediatrician taught me. With my first daughter, I was struggling with breastfeeding. We didn't really perfect her latch until she was probably about two weeks old. And then it all got better from there. But she said you can notice if they're not emptying your breast by looking at their diaper. And this is what you'll see. See if in their diapers you notice that their poop should be seedy. If they're a breastfed baby, that is normal. But if it is green, that means that they are consuming mostly 4 milk. If it's more of a yellow mustardy color, that means that they're getting that high fat hind milk. Though it is true that your baby is technically getting enough milk if they're having a proper weight gain and they're having a proper number of wet diapers in a day, you really want baby to try get that fattier milk because it's better for them and it has more nutrients. So correcting this issue is going to first come from their latch. If they have a bad latch, they're going to struggle to breastfeed in general. And a lactation consultant can really help you with this. Sometimes babies have a good latch, but they're sleepy at the breast. So some things to try to help a sleepy baby at the breast would be getting the baby undressed from their pajamas or whatever they're wearing and changing their diaper right away. If baby's still sleepy, you can try tickling their feet or putting a cool rig on their forehead and stroking their back. That has always worked with both of my girls. And sometimes they're just so sleepy that they're being kind of lazy at the breast. Also, offering both sides is always an important thing to do. Some people will tell you only spend so many minutes on one side and then switch to the other. I prefer to let them pull themselves off of the first side while I'm using Haaka and then I will offer the second side. If they don't want the second side, sometimes I will pump to relieve that and empty the breast so that it can refill and know that it needs to continue to make more milk. If you are not allowing them to finish feeding on a side, they may not get to that hind milk and they may be just having that foremilk. So I hope this helps and hopefully you can look at your newborns diapers and kind of figure out how feeding is going for them and if they're getting that fatty hind milk.","2 kinds of breast milk üêÑ #breastfeeding #breastfeedingmama #pumping #pumpingmom #2under2 #milkstorage #lactation #girlmom #babytok #baby #milksupply #workingmom #momof2 Second pump of the day.

I work as an under supplier, so right now I'm power pumping. I pumped for 20 minutes, rested for 10, pumped for 10, rested for 10 and pumping for 10. This is my last one. So we got about nine minutes to go. Got my water here, my body armor, and I feel like I want to do this journey on TikTok because I know that there are some of you out there that are going through the same thing. I honestly go on TikTok and I get so discouraged because I see all these moms when they pump, they're pumping like 10 ounces per session. I get on a good day, like 14 ounces a day. A day. And that's why I'm pumping at work. Because when I get home I also put my daughter to the breast. So obviously, you know, I don't know how you guys do it. Like I've tried everything. Lactation, cookies, body armor, coconut water, coconut oil. Everything in the books that you can think of doing. Like literally the flange size, I changed it and everything. And it's just, it, it, it's, it' frustrating that I can't get that much. You know, sometimes I just want to give up. So what I have started doing now is that instead of using those really big like bottle to pump, I'm using these little oops, these little Medella ones that only go up to 2.5 ounces. Just I don't feel so bad as not looking at that big bottle and being like, wow, I only filled up 1oz so I don't feel so bad with these. And I'm wearing my friend's sweater cuz it's freezing here. Like look whole like it's like 60 degrees in here. Like nobody's here. So if you work at the health department, put the degrees off. So this is my slacker boop. This is my, my left and this is my right. This is how much I pumped this morning. This is only two ounces. Here we have like a little bit over one and a half and then here we literally one and a half. So let's see how much we get. This is a 12 ounce container. So yeah, this is how much we got. So if that was one and a half to over, this is probably like almost eight and I leave work at four. So don't give up. If you are going to what I'm going to and you're an under supplier at work.

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok ","How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go.

If you don't agree with formula feeding, that's totally okay, and you are entitled to your opinion! However, please refrain from dropping your opinions here - this is not the place üôÉ #formulafeeding #mixedfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingstruggles #forumlafeedingmoms #formulafeedingtips #formulafeedinghacks #babybrezza #lactation #lowmilksupply #formulatransition #formulatransitiontips #momtok #momsoftiktok  How I transitioned my daughter onto formula and then a few things that I did before even going to formula to make my life easier. Giving them that first bottle of formula is by far the hardest part. Once you've overcome that first bottle, that first hurdle, formula feeding becomes a lot easier mentally and emotionally. I started by mixed feeding, so essentially I would still breastfeed and then if my daughter needed a top up, I'd give her a small amount of formula in a bottle. And then I just continued doing that till eventually our breastfeeding decreased and our formula top ups continued. And then event transition fully to formula. We will say we went through probably a one to two week period of fussiness just as she got used to it. Now, a few things I did to make the transition easier. When I knew I was going to start introducing formula, before I even started introducing it, I made sure I had all of the things at home that I needed and got formula. I went out and got bottles, I got my sterilizer out, then I washed all the bottles, sterilized all the bottles and had everything set up ready to go. At the time, I was using a baby brezza machine as well. So I got that out, cleaned it up, put the formula in, set it all up ready to go. This was before I was even using the formula, but it just made it so much easier when I made that switch because then I didn't have to think of the logistics and it just made the transition so much smoother because it allowed me to not have to think about the practicalities. Everything was already done, it was ready to go and I just had to implement the feeds. If you guys want to see the specific products that I use now to make my life with formula feeding easier, because I have changed a few things, let me know and I can do a video on the products that I love for formula feeding mums.

I got like honey all over my stuff in my lunchbox, so ignore me. Honey and granola on the overnight oats. Like I'm telling y'all, I like demolished these. They were really good. And yeah, like I said, I think it's helping my supply. I'm trying to drink water. I hate water. It has no taste. It freaks me out. But I'm doing it for my girl.

Just gonna make some bottles and bag some milk with Mackenzie today. So her speech appointment was actually really fun. It was basically just a big playroom and they observed her playing and how she's interacting with things and talking while she's playing and basically just asking me a bunch of questions to assess where she is. She is saying about 60 words so that's good. I didn't know how many she was saying until they gave me a checklist. We figured that out and then we went outside to play because the sun was shining. It was a beautiful day yesterday. So it feels like spring, but I know it's not. I know it's gonna snow again because that's how it always goes. Starts to feel like spring and then just shuts us right back down. But I'm loving because I like to be able to take her outside this way. She obviously really likes to talk, so that's good. It's not like she's not talking but most of the time it's just gibberish or gibberish. Nothing too much going on with us today she's gonna go to her grandparents house and mama's gonna have a break. Still am gonna have the baby but I get a Mackenzie break which I can get some stuff done easier with the baby because he sleeps a lot more. She has stopped taking naps but she's been sleeping in so I think I would rather that. But like when did your guys kids stop taking naps? Because she's almost two and I thought they take naps like for a while still. So I was a little unprepared because I love nap time. That's like my me time during the day. You know, even if her brother's awake, he's just laying there being all chill. So I like the fat is really stuck. I really like my me time. I'm sad that's going on but let me know when your guys kids stop napping. Just because I'm curious at what ages that happens. Mackenzie, can you move that? She got this coloring board thing for her birthday and she is loving it. It's like the magic doodle. I think it says magic doodle board but she's obsessed with it. She colors on it most of the day. A couple of six ounce bags and then maybe one more bot. Thank you to everybody who is following me. I'm still trying really hard to get enough views.

Just bagging milk today. Bagging in, making bottles. I'm mostly probably gonna make bottles, but haven't been on in a little while. It's been kind of a hectic week. My husband's out of town, so just been really busy with the kids, going to appointments. We were able to get a stronger cream for James's eczema, and the first time I put it on yesterday, I could already see it, like, disappearing. So hopefully it will be all gone soon and he can have that clear baby face again. But I gotta keep layering lotion on him so that he stays nice and. And lotionized so he doesn't get too much more eczema, hopefully. Last night I did put. I know this is frowned upon, but I did put a little bit of rice cereal in his bottle before. And some people may say it's frowned upon, some people may not. But he actually slept the longest he slept ever, so I might start doing that because it was really awesome. I tried giving him some, like, in a bowl, and he didn't seem like he was just like, spitting it out. So I don't think he's ready for actual, like, solids and stuff. So, yeah, I'm just gonna put it in his bottle at night and hope he keeps sleeping longer. Oh, for those of that don't know, there's this thick fat layer on the top. I don't know if you can see it, but that is really good for your breast milk for when you're moving weight. When I had my daughter, it took me a little bit to figure that out. So it's always good to eat, like, healthy, fatty foods to get that good thick fat layer, which sometimes it's not as thick. But this has been sit. This is like the third day of this sitting in my fridge. So it really has to get drank today. So that's why the fat layer was like, extra. You could see it really good because it's been sitting there for a little bit. I was running out of containers to put my milk in, so I think I will bag some today. He is still drinking 5 ounces, but I still bag six just because I like to use the full advantage of the bag. What is the date today? It's the 9th, so yeah, I'm gonna try starting to get on here every day again. I. I know I still didn't post the video of me redoing my weekly calendar. I honestly didn't do it this week because I was just. I've been so busy that I haven't had time to really do my normal chores and stuff. I have done, like, the dishes and, of course, like, daily things, but, like, I'm behind on laundry. I really thrown off this week. So next week, the goal is to do that. Hopefully it finally warmed up outside, so I was able to take my daughter outside to play yesterday. It's really nice because my neighbors, they have young children too, kind of close age with her, so it's nice when she gets to play with other kids because she loves it. This should just be maybe one more bottle. I might not be able to b. I'll probably bag one more bag. I'm running out of, like. So right now, the coffee creamer I have is, like, the cinnamon roll one. And I have the white chocolate raspberry, which both are really good. But, like, what do you guys put in your coffee? Like, trying to think of, like, different kind of creamers. Trying to find a new flavor. I really liked the caramel macchiato one, but I think I'm kind of getting tired of it now. So I need to think of, like, a new one to. To use because I am a coffee creamer girl. Like, I cannot drink my coffee black because I'm a wussy. Plus, I like the sweetness. Like, I'm a sweet. I got a sweet tooth. And me and my husb. And pretty much cut sweets out of our house, like cookies and, you know, dessert sweet things. So when I drink my coffee, that's like my sweet treat of the day. But. Yeah, so let me know what you guys use, because I want to try something different. Okay, so we got four bottles. Wait. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 bottles and then a half.

I wanted to talk about my journey and why I choose to exclusively pump for my daughter. Before I gave birth, I was very open to any way of feeding her because I knew that the most important thing was just her being fed and gaining weight like she was supposed to. I had my pump all ready to go. My parts were sterilized, bottles cleaned, sterilized. I had formula if I needed it, and I also had all of my things for potentially trying to nurse her. I had a C section, and once we were moved to our postpartum room, I immediately started trying to nurse her. The nurses were really helpful and gave me a lot of advice, and I also had a lactation consultant. She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too.","Why I chose to exclusively pump. üçº This wasn‚Äôt the journey I imagined and I still feel sad that I didn‚Äôt nurse my daughter, but I‚Äôm thankful for all that I have been able to provide for her. üíï #firsttimemom #ftm #exclusivepumping #exclusivepumper #overproducer #pitchermethod #bagmilkwithme #frozenmilk #baggingmilk #milkstorage #pumpingmom #pumpingmama #freezerstash #milkbricks #pumptok #spectrapump  Hey, everyone, come along with me as we bag some milk from the last few days.

She was latching with a Shield, but after 24 hours, a nurse told me that the shield was a crutch and I shouldn't use it anymore. When I took the shield off, we started having latching issues. She would get really frustrated and that would also make me really frustrated because I wanted to be able to provide for her and I was really struggling. This only got worse when we went home and I was trying to recover at home. I was in a lot of pain physically and then also trying to nurse her on top of that and just having the latching issues was really stressful. We went to the doctor the next day to see how her weight gain was going, and she was 7 pounds, 2 ounces at birth. She had lost an entire pound at this point. This is three days postpartum and that was way more than they wanted her to lose. I got really scared because I felt like I was failing her. The pediatrician said that I could keep going and trying to nurse her. She set up appointments with a lactation consultant. She gave me tons of advice and I really appreciated that. But she also told me that if I wanted to try and pump and give her milk so I could see the ounces she was taking in, that's completely fine too. She even said that she was an exclusive pumper because she knew she was going to be returning to work with her children. Her being so upfront about it all was really comforting to me. We got home, I tried to nurse her. She wasn't latching, and so I made the decision that I needed to pump some milk to try and give to her for that feed. I gave her a two ounce bottle and she ate every single ounce of it. I'm pretty sure I cried at that moment because I was just so happy to know that she was eating. However, that happiness didn't necessarily last too long. When my daughter went down for her next nap, I remember sobbing to my husband because I told him I felt like pumping was going to be the journey I needed and I mourned the fact that I wasn't going to nurse her like I wanted. I didn't realize how emotional I was going to be making that decision and to this day I still feel guilt not nursing her but at the same time I do know that I am doing what's best for my daughter. No matter how you choose to feed your child, you're doing the best thing for them. Our nursing journey ended really early and to some people they may say, wow, you should have kept going. But for our family, my anxiety and my mental health, I'm very glad that I chose this bond pumping journey. I've been very lucky to not only provide nutrition for my daughter but also to donate some milk to a local mama too."

I'm really not sure how I became an over supplier, but here are some of the things that I've done to help me on my breastfeeding journey. My number one tip is to drink as much water as you can.

Now if you're anything like me and you've been eyeing the Cerise Chill for quite a bit now, but you're not sure if you want to make the splurge, let me show you everything that the Cerise Cho can do. I decided I should make this video because I am on a Facebook support page and there was a couple of girls on there asking what the hype around the Cerise Chill was and if it was really actually worth the price. Starting off by saying this is how I used to carry all my stuff on the go before now I just carry this. It's just this, my pumping diaper bag. I'm gonna make a video on everything that I have in here. Let me know, I'd be happy to make one. So what makes this worth it if it's perfectly inside your bag and you carry this around? Now they sell the demigod this one and they sell the OG one. The OG one holds up to 27 ounces I believe on the outer chamber and it holds 12 ounces in the inner chamber. Now the way that this works is you can either put ice in this part and put your milk in here like this and it'll keep your milk cool for 20 plus hours or you can store your milk in this chamber right here, the 12 ounce chamber ice in here and it'll keep your milk cool as well. Now this can also serve as a bottle warmer. So you can just go ahead and pour hot water in here. Only works if you have the Dr. Brown's bottle, the narrow neck one. Go ahead and put it right here like this. Go ahead and heat your bottle off in a matter of minutes. Now let's say you're pumping on the go and you forgot your storage containers. The cool thing about this is you can go ahead and pump directly into this as well. Connect your pump to it and pump directly into it. Not only that, but you can also pump directly into the cap as well. Take this off right here. So you can also go ahead and use the cap as a place to pump into. You have two ways to pump into with the Cerise chill. Aside for that from that I went out with my husband the other day and when we came back I left the Ceri Cho on the counter and I took the milk out, ice was in here and I left it with the cap off. Next day at around 5 o'clock so it had already been about 22 hours since we went out. There was still ice in there and that was with the cap off. I think it's a lot easier to find ice on the go, whereas to find ice packs on the go. I used to have a cooler bag for when I was on the go. I ended up not liking it because I've had 40 plus ounces go bad on inside of that. I live it gets extremely hot. I've never had ice go bad inside the service chill. If you don't want a big one you can go ahead and get the small one. The demi got this one. If not the big one works just fine as well. I love it. And thing is it doesn't have to be just used for breast milk. So after your breastfeeding journey you can use this thing for pretty much coffee, water, anything you want. We're spending 50 plus dollars on Stanley's. You can make the splurge on this side. If you are a first responder or active duty member then you can go ahead and get 20% off of your cerise ch through gobex. Personally I believe it's worth the price that you pay for it just because of all the things that it can do. If that's still a little bit too expensive for you, then there is ways that you can make your own makeshift cerise chill. And if you want to know how you can do that, go ahead and let me know in the comments. I'd be happy to make a video for you guys on that.","Is the ceres chill actually worth it?

I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right.

We‚Äôve reached 1000 followers & just wanted to say thank you! I never thought I would create content on tiktok but here we are, I love this little community of mothers. Women empowerment! I still remember the first mama on here to follow me! It was @KayCeeBabeeyyy‚ú®ü§ç ! So thank you so much for incorporating me into this community I didnt know existed ! ü§ç‚ú® #exclusivelypumping #pumpingmom #liquidgold #zomeez2 #exclusivepumping #lactancia #lactation #milkstorage #pitchermethod #breastmilkstorage #pumpingmama  Hello to all of the beautiful mamas out there. I hope you guys are having a great day. I had recently shared with some of you guys that my milk supply had diminished a bit and honestly I was kind of freaking out about it. Whenever I see a slight diminish in my milk supply, my anxiety skyrockets. I know that's not good. I'm trying to work on it and be easier on myself, but I definitely have my moments where anxiety takes over. I was dealing with the stress of an overseas move and a medical screening all within such a small time frame, but thankfully we were able to push all of that back to May. So I feel as if all the stress in my body lifted up and is completely gone and that reflected upon my milk supply. Honestly, the human body is amazing and it still kind of baffles me what stre stress can do to your body. But yeah, I feel as if I can finally breathe. I saw another mama on her post and I can't remember what her name was and one of my favorite creators as well. Milkness. Never give up on a bad day. And yes, that is so right. It's okay to have bad days, but just never give up on one. We've also reached 1,000 followers, so I'm so happy because of that. I still remember the very first mama that followed me on here and that is Casey Baby. So Casey Baby, thank you so much for following me. You were the first one and yeah, you incorporated me into this wonderful community of mothers. So shout out to you and thank you to everybody else. Hope you all have a great day and enjoy this life.

One is the bags, like everybody else, that are dated based on when you expressed your milk. And then the other is this ice tray that is made up of 1oz bars. When you start bagging your milk, your baby could be drinking that milk months from now. So you have no idea how big their bottles are going to be or what they're going to prefer when they're actually ready to drink the milk. So when it comes to how much I put in a bag, I switch it up. I'll do two ounce bags, three ounce bags, four, four and a half, five. Like, I'll just do any amount so that when my husband or I are like, searching through for what my baby needs when she's ready to drink a bottle, there's something in there that will meet what she needs. But let's say I have a bag of milk that's about to expire and I need to use it up. But there's only two ounce bags left in there. And I know that she drinks three ounces for every bottle. Then I can just throw one of these bars in that bottle too. So my freezer is made up of bags that look like this. Bags that look like this. And based on a combination of those things, I think she'll be able to get what she needs. So I'm getting ready to freeze this milk in my pitcher and start a new pitcher. I'll probably start with the 10 ounces that I have here and then I'll switch to bags for the bags. Everything's going to be dated as old as the oldest milk in the picture. So 1424 is what all these bags are going to say based on the amount left in here. I'll just kind of start picking arbitrary amounts. I always measure in a bottle first because the bags do have the measurement ticks, but it's really hard and inaccurate to measure inside the B. This is actually a big milestone because that was my last motif bag from when I was pregnant. I ordered my very first bags. So I'm gonna try these Lansino bags next. I'm very excited. The things that we get excited about these days. So just a reminder what this milk is. This is right around three days of what's left over in a pitcher after I pump into it and pour bottles out of it. And everything left over that isn't going to make it into a bottle gets frozen. Just remember to lay them flat in the freezer and then you can store them in bags.

I am pumping on the go. I had to run a bunch of errands today, and my last errand is getting my mom haircut. Stay tuned. My husband is giving her a bottle at home, and my philosophy is, whenever she gets a bottle, I should be pumping, and that's how I keep up with my supply. By the time I get home, she's gonna want to breastfeed. So I need to pump while I'm on the go. So this is a brand new experience. The last place I popped my pump into my bra, and I drove to my hair appointment, and I'm finishing up my pump here in the parking lot. I have about five minutes left. I feel like this is really good practice for me because I'm getting ready to go back to work, and I almost never pump during the day, and I never have to practice, like, storing milk on the go. So this is a great little test run for how everything's going to work when I go back. Okay. My test run went pretty terribly because I accidentally. I spilled milk all over myself, which is devastating for a million reasons. We're just going to go with it. We are going to try to stay positive. What a terrible outcome. This is a Sarah's chill. It's great for traveling and for when you have to pump on the go. This chamber right now holds ice for me because I wanted to use the bigger chamber for milk. You can also do it the opposite. You can put ice in here and use this for milk. You can pump directly into it if you want to. You can put warm milk in it, and it's the same as putting it into the refrigerator. So it's kind of amazing. Here's my cup that I spilled, about half of which is absolutely devastating. Here's my other cup. These are the Kiss Bobo 1508. The reason that I brought these along is because they are so easy to take on the go. They have so few parts. All of my other pumps have tons and tons of parts. So these are great to just take for this exact purpose. So I'm gonna go clean myself off. Let's try to stay calm. Let's try to recover, and let's go get our haircut. I.

And I was sent a new or two new Kiss Bobo pumps and asked to review them. And I just. I can't lie about it. So I've been going for 16 minutes. First impressions? They're loud. Very, very loud. I've actually never heard them quite so loud. All my old pumps have been, like, purposely quiet. I still thought they were a little bit loud. And it's only now compared to how loud this is, I'm like, oh, those babies were quite quiet. Say out loud. They're not painful. I've got the right flanges in them. I've not had to lube up. I'm not convinced I'm getting any milk. I checked it about eight minutes and had a droplet. So I've put it up to, like, strength. I can't fucking strength. So the buttons don't seem to recognize all the time. I just had to press those buttons, like, six times. Get to do what I need it to. Does have a timer, though, which I'm a big fan. Scoop has just turned itself off of its own accord. I don't know why, but I do have other pumps that turn itself off when they think it's full. So let's see. This one's gone as well now. I don't know. Maybe it's a time thing. Okay. Like, two ounces, and that one's even worse. So all in all, there was a lot of stuff that came with the pump. I was quite impressed with the pump itself because a lot of stuff came with it. But if it's not gonna, you know, do its job and pump for me, then I'm probably not a massive fan of it. Oh, my God. That was misleading. This is painfully slow. Excuse me. The reason I just made that mistake is because there's a hole here where the milk actually comes out from. But it looks like it's going to come out from there. It doesn't. So let's see if this one's any easier to pull. Yeah, like 5 ounces. I don't know. I mean, it's definitely not the best pump I've used. That was really difficult to pour. Maybe it would take practice.","Replying to @Tyla okay im undecided!

I cannot wait to see your whole journey. And you are going to be just fine, I promise you. So I was able to exclusively pump for my two littlest ones. I did not breastfeed the first one, but the two little ones, I had to pump for them because they wouldn't latch. So I had no choice but to pump when I was gone. And let me tell you, it is a learning curve, but you can do it. Make sure to take your lunchbox filled with ice packs. Have a separate one that's exclusively full for your milk bags.

I cannot wait to see your whole journey. And you are going to be just fine, I promise you. So I was able to exclusively pump for my two littlest ones. I did not breastfeed the first one, but the two little ones, I had to pump for them because they wouldn't latch. So I had no choice but to pump when I was gone. And let me tell you, it is a learning curve, but you can do it. Make sure to take your lunchbox filled with ice packs. Have a separate one that's exclusively full for your milk bags. And they will stay fresh that way. They'll stay, you know, clean and everything. And then also getting ice from the plane helps, too. And then also the refrigerators in the hotels. I tried to stay clear of flying 40 trips because at that point it was a little bit harder to keep the milk fresh. But you can definitely do it. Just make sure it's on ice the whole time."

Trying to produce more milk at the moment has been a little bit rough. Monday, I didn't really get that much. And then Tuesday, I didn't even pump. Wednesday, it's my day off, so I don't need to pump. And today, you guys, I seriously felt, like, so useless because. Because you will see at the end of the video what happened with my milk. So today at work, there was no ice, quite literally. I was drinking hot water all day, and I was not about to drink body armor hot, because in my opinion, body armor is disgusting when it's hot. It's only good when it is cold. And I was pretty upset at the fact that I literally, like, did not hydrate as much as I should have. And you guys, look, my ganito freaking melted. That is how hot it was. I. I was so upset. So, you guys, I also did try the cheesy munchy mix. It was okay. I prefer the spicy one, but it did hit the spot a bit because I was honestly super duper hungry. But overall, a 10 out of 10. Well, not a 10 out of 10 was like an 8 out of 10 maybe.

The answer is absolutely without a doubt. As long as both of them are still good, they haven't expired, by all means, combine them into one bottle. This can be a really great way to use up some older breast milk, but combine it with fresher breast milk to have added nutrient value to the older breast milk. Because the longer breast milk sits in the freezer, the more the nutrients kind of break down and degrade. So adding it into one that has more freshly pumped milk, that can be a really great option. You can combine of frozen milk with a bottle of freshly expressed breast milk. Once you've thawed this out, combine them together. Absolutely. You just want to make sure that you're following the milk storage guidelines for the oldest milk, right? So this one, as soon as they take it out of the freezer, once it is fully thawed, this is only good in the fridge for 24 hours. So if you combine it with freshly expressed breast milk, you're going to need to make sure that you use all of that milk together within 24 hours. If you take both of these out of the freezer, you thaw them together, you combine them, this is good for 24 hours in the fridge. That's the big biggest thing, is just making sure that you are taking that into consideration as well. But you can, by all means, you can combine pump sessions from different days from the fridge, combine them together. You can combine frozen breast milk with fresh breast milk, combine two different bags of frozen breast milk. You can do whatever it is that you're wanting to do, as long as you're following the individual milk storage recommendations and guidelines for each individual packet and going by the oldest milk. And if you want a refresher, a resource just that goes through all of those milk storage guidelines. I actually have a free milk storage handout that you can access through the link in my bio.

Like as soon as they're born, probably would have got to have a lot more peaceful dinners because in the beginning, like she just did not want to be put down.

Oh my gosh. Got a lot of milk to bag. So. Hello, my name is Lisa. I am a primarily nursing mom who pumps when she has to go into the office for work. And I am a recovering oversupplier, meaning I've had an oversupply for my eight to nine months of postpartum. I'm nine months postpartum, but I am very quickly turning into a just enougher. So my supply is dropping, which seems kind of ironic with all this milk right here. But this is basically everything I pumped when I was away from my daughter. So I've been in the office three days this week. So that means that there are basically at least six feedings that she has taken from my milk reserve and then has been pumped into these bags. So now we are going to be combining, I use the pitcher method and I'm going to be combining this milk and bagging it to freeze for later. So when she goes to her babysitter or yeah, when she goes to her babysitter, I literally just pack frozen milk into her lunchbox and her babysitter will thaw it and warm it while she's there. So we're going to go through and just mix this. So this is milk from the last few days. Today is Thursday, this milk started being collected on Monday. So we're about four days in. And I use the pitcher method. I like to use mason jars because I can still use them after I'm done breastfeeding. And so this is I think a 32 ounce jar with the lid. So you can get this actually on TikTok Shop, so I'll link it below for you. And so, so I like to use this because I'm not an exclusive pumper and even though I do have an oversupply, it's not like a super crazy outrageous amount. So I don't really worry about having to get these huge containers. And some people like to use like the breast milk, not the breast milk, the formula ones. But I won't need it after I'm done breastfeeding. So I try to kind of keep it separate. So I'm going to do five ounce increments. I'm going to break apart my milk. I'm going to do some five ounces, some three and two because sometimes she likes to drink more than five ounces, but I've been freezing five ounces so I'm going to give some top off amounts that we can do. So I'm going to start with this. I'm going to do 30 ounces. So that means I'm going to do six bags first. All right. So when you date the milk, you also date it by the oldest milk that you have when you combine. So that will be the 13th. So I measure using these milk collector bottles. I have the Medilla or Medela. I don't really know how to say it. Okay, so we have this going to do 5 ounces. It's a little bit more than 5, but you know you lose a little bit when you take it out of the bag, all that stuff. So we're just going to count it as five. So I want to get all of the air out. So I'll close it about 90% and then just squeeze. I'm going to tap to get the air bubbles out of this side and I like to push it until a little bit of milk goes up into that zipper. So I know all the air is out. But you may choose not to do that. Okay, so this one is only two ounces. So I'm going to go ahead and label this bag 2 ounces and pour it in there because I want to do some two and three ounce increments anyway. So we're going to go ahead and do that and I'm going to set this to the side for a second because I hate getting permanent marker on my hands and combine the rest of my milk in here. So these are disposable? Well, these are mom cozy bags. I like to pump into them when I'm at work. So it's got this like screw top. And so I put an adapter onto my Spectra pump and when I'm at work it just pumps right into the bag. So I know, you know, like they go. I put this into this jar. But it's easy when I'm at work because I can just literally put the cap on and go. I don't have. I have access to a sink, but I have to go to another floor and I don't really like doing that. So I'll just go through, put the caps on and then I will put my flanges in my mini fridge to keep them cool until my next pumping session. So that just saves me on space and on things that I have to clean really is what it is. I don't know about you, but I never pump the same amount on each side and I never pump the same amount in each pump. So besides the fact that these don't really store very well, they don't really save space. It would be difficult to like really Control the volume no matter what. So like I mentioned before, I combo feed and the fact that like I pump and nurse, I nurse whenever I can. If I'm with my baby, I will nurse her. I do have one additional pump every day on top of her nursing because she sleeps through the night. So she sleeps anywhere from 7, sometimes earlier, sometimes later, until 6:30 in the morning. So to make sure my supply stays up, I do a pump before bed. I used to also do a middle of the night pumpkin, but I stopped that just shy of two months ago mainly because I had that weird iPhone glitch that my alarm didn't go off in the middle of the night anyway, so I kept sleeping through it. I did my middle of the night pump for actually quite a while because I have pcos. I think it's part of the reason why it took me so long to get pregnant. It took four years. So one of the things with PCOS is it can affect your milk supply. Many women have a really bad milk supply or doesn't really come in. So I was very fortunate and very blessed to have not only a good milk supply but a little bit of an oversupply. But because I had pcos, I was very afraid that if I eased up on my pumping that I would just completely lose my supply. So I kept my pumping up so that I could build up freezer stash in case that did happen and just to keep myself going as long as I could. So thankfully I have a really big freezer stash and now my. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this mess is everywhere. And so now my supply has dropped. But also I am nine months postpartum and my daughter is also taking in solids. So it's just kind of the natural progression of things. My goal is to breastfeed at least a year. I would love to go 18 months. I wouldn't mind going 24. We'll see how it goes. I mean I just take it one step at a time. I for sure want to make it to 12 and then we will see if she wants to self wean or whatever. Now I, I'm not going to nurse her to the frequency that I do now, of course, but you know, maybe nurse before bed or whatever, what have you. I know that there are some good benefits to breast milk later so we'll just see how it goes. I'm. I'm kind of open to whatever. All right, so I have a two ounce, so I'm going to do a three ounce. I'm going to hold it in front of me since. Since I can't really pour. Okay, so we're going to do 3 ounces. Let's see how much is left in here. So we are looking at about 20 ounces. So we're going to do some like, things that break down into five. That's it. That's our bagging. I gotta wipe off this counter because so much milk has gotten on it. So let's see how much we got. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 63, 63 ounces of breast milk. So this is a little bit of an oversupply, but really this is also supplementing feeds that she's gotten through the day. So I would say it's probably about 10 ounces per day. Ish. Not even. And don't forget that I do nurse her some days. So this replaces what we have. But I do have a little bit of an oversupply. So we're going to go ahead and freeze this. And then now I just have to wash bottles.","My oversupply has lowered a lot so most of this milk is just replacing what is being given while I'm away. This is 63 ounces over the course of 4 days.

And so I put an adapter onto my Spectra pump and when I'm at work it just pumps right into the bag. So I know, you know, like they go. I put this into this jar. But it's easy when I'm at work because I can just literally put the cap on and go. I don't have. I have access to a sink, but I have to go to another floor and I don't really like doing that. So I'll just go through, put the caps on and then I will put my flanges in my mini fridge to keep them cool until my next pumping session. So that just saves me on space and on things that I have to clean really is what it is. I don't know about you, but I never pump the same amount on each side and I never pump the same amount in each pump. So besides the fact that these don't really store very well, they don't really save space. It would be difficult to like really Control the volume no matter what. So like I mentioned before, I combo feed and the fact that like I pump and nurse, I nurse whenever I can. If I'm with my baby, I will nurse her. I do have one additional pump every day on top of her nursing because she sleeps through the night. So she sleeps anywhere from 7, sometimes earlier, sometimes later, until 6:30 in the morning. So to make sure my supply stays up, I do a pump before bed. I used to also do a middle of the night pumpkin, but I stopped that just shy of two months ago mainly because I had that weird iPhone glitch that my alarm didn't go off in the middle of the night anyway, so I kept sleeping through it. I did my middle of the night pump for actually quite a while because I have pcos. I think it's part of the reason why it took me so long to get pregnant. It took four years. So one of the things with PCOS is it can affect your milk supply. Many women have a really bad milk supply or doesn't really come in. So I was very fortunate and very blessed to have not only a good milk supply but a little bit of an oversupply. But because I had pcos, I was very afraid that if I eased up on my pumping that I would just completely lose my supply. So I kept my pumping up so that I could build up freezer stash in case that did happen and just to keep myself going as long as I could. So thankfully I have a really big freezer stash and now my. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this mess is everywhere. And so now my supply has dropped. But also I am nine months postpartum and my daughter is also taking in solids. So it's just kind of the natural progression of things. My goal is to breastfeed at least a year. I would love to go 18 months. I wouldn't mind going 24. We'll see how it goes. I mean I just take it one step at a time. I for sure want to make it to 12 and then we will see if she wants to self wean or whatever. Now I, I'm not going to nurse her to the frequency that I do now, of course, but you know, maybe nurse before bed or whatever, what have you. I know that there are some good benefits to breast milk later so we'll just see how it goes. I'm. I'm kind of open to whatever. All right, so I have a two ounce, so I'm going to do a three ounce. I'm going to hold it in front of me since. Since I can't really pour. Okay, so we're going to do 3 ounces. Let's see how much is left in here. So we are looking at about 20 ounces. So we're going to do some like, things that break down into five. That's it. That's our bagging. I gotta wipe off this counter because so much milk has gotten on it. So let's see how much we got. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 63, 63 ounces of breast milk. So this is a little bit of an oversupply, but really this is also supplementing feeds that she's gotten through the day. So I would say it's probably about 10 ounces per day. Ish. Not even. And don't forget that I do nurse her some days. So this replaces what we have. But I do have a little bit of an oversupply. So we're going to go ahead and freeze this. And then now I just have to wash bottles."

This morning, my mom gave me, or she told me, oh, you have some mail that's pretty concerning. And I didn't know what it could be, but it was this mail from the DA or district attorney, county of Orange. And I opened it because I. I didn't know what it was. And we live in San Francisco, not Orange County. So then I opened it and read it. And it started off by saying, this is your notice of victim rights in the above case. If you have questions or input, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, what did I do in Orange County? And then I remembered last week when we were on our trip on Saturday, we were shopping at the outlets, and then we got a call from the Orange county police that our car window was broken. And so we were already leaving, changing my son's diaper right before we were leaving. And so we're walking out, like, what the hell? Like, really, this had to happen to us. And we go out to the lot. It's a big parking lot, and we see multiple police cars. The first set of police car I see was like, in the far back of the lot. We parked in the middle of the lot, in the middle row. But then I see there's a lot of police cars. So then we go up and they're like, oh, is this your car? And we were like, yes. And then we look around and the windshield is smashed. I will insert a photo. But then it wasn't only our car. There was like four to six other cars with their windshields were smashed in. And, you know, we were like, what happened? And they just said a homeless dude was vandalizing the cars. They have him in custody, but it was this big thing. But when I got this mail, I forgot about it because we got it fixed the same day because we're going to Disney the next day, and we didn't want it to ruin our trip. So that's what happened last week. And, you know, things happen, unfortunately, happen to us. Luckily, we were able to find somebody do it the same day, because we did not want to have it, get it towed, because the police said, it's up to you if you want to drive it or not, because it was already cracking in. There's glass on the windshield. What happened?

This morning, my mom gave me, or she told me, oh, you have some mail that's pretty concerning. And I didn't know what it could be, but it was this mail from the DA or district attorney, county of Orange. And I opened it because I. I didn't know what it was. And we live in San Francisco, not Orange County. So then I opened it and read it. And it started off by saying, this is your notice of victim rights in the above case. If you have questions or input, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, what did I do in Orange County? And then I remembered last week when we were on our trip on Saturday, we were shopping at the outlets, and then we got a call from the Orange county police that our car window was broken. And so we were already leaving, changing my son's diaper right before we were leaving. And so we're walking out, like, what the hell? Like, really, this had to happen to us. And we go out to the lot. It's a big parking lot, and we see multiple police cars. The first set of police car I see was like, in the far back of the lot. We parked in the middle of the lot, in the middle row. But then I see there's a lot of police cars. So then we go up and they're like, oh, is this your car? And we were like, yes. And then we look around and the windshield is smashed. I will insert a photo. But then it wasn't only our car. There was like four to six other cars with their windshields were smashed in. And, you know, we were like, what happened? And they just said a homeless dude was vandalizing the cars. They have him in custody, but it was this big thing. But when I got this mail, I forgot about it because we got it fixed the same day because we're going to Disney the next day, and we didn't want it to ruin our trip. So that's what happened last week. And, you know, things happen, unfortunately, happen to us. Luckily, we were able to find somebody do it the same day, because we did not want to have it, get it towed, because the police said, it's up to you if you want to drive it or not, because it was already cracking in. There's glass on the windshield. What happened? Nobody got hurt, and it's all fixed, but there you go."

It's bagging booby milk time. Breast milk for the surrogate baby that I had two weeks ago. This is all that I got in 32 hour period. So let's see how many ounces we get. Remember, always swish the milk. Don't shake it. You want to get all of the fat. Hang on, honey. Okay. All the fat here is all the nutrients. You want to keep that, so swish it. Keep it. All right, so I'm just measuring out into 5 ounce bottles so that everything is even for 5 ounces. It just has been freezing really flat. And really nice for sending my last box, I put in 165 ounces in the box to the surrogate family. So I'll be doing that again because they're mailing the box back to me, so I'll be able to send that again. So again, just switching to get all the fat off the sides and then making it all an even five. All right, so I'm gonna name and date or date and put how many ounces in for 20 bags and we'll see if that's enough. Milwaukee Sharpie best. Remember, always getting the air out, because I'm going to be. And this is what it's like with a toddler. Oh, okay. I'm not gonna talk again. Let's just bag some milk. Yes, honey pie. What? Anytime you talk, they talk. Right. Again, I'm nailing this, freezing it, and mailing it to the surrogate family. So this is just two days worth of milk. So we'll see how much I'm gonna have. I missed bagging yesterday. Sorry. It happens. But back to my story. I am feeling really good. I only had a couple spouts of crying, and it had nothing to even do with the baby. I was literally sitting at the dinner table and I was pumping and I just started crying. So postpartum is totally real, and I'm not gonna lie for a second. Hold that thought. My husband has been very supportive that way, telling me if I need anything. Actually, on the way to the hospital, he had said, I don't care what anybody else thinks, and I don't care what happens, but if there is anything wrong, I want you to tell me and we can go from there. And if you need to get help, we will figure it out. Talk to my surrogacy agency lady today. And she said, most people don't realize that when you have. Yes, honey. Okay. When you have a surrogate baby, postpartum doesn't come as much if you just have your own baby at home. Because postpartum usually comes from the sleep deprivation and just being go, go, go, go, go. Pumping, waking up all the time. Yeah, I'm waking up to pump, but I'm not taking care of a another human. I have three kids of my own, pretty self sufficient. My two year old sleeps through the night, she has forever. So I don't feel like I have postpartum, which is great. I feel good and if I did, I would reach out to someone and talk to someone. So if you think that you might have postpartum and you're watching this, please reach out to someone because it is real and it's not something to mess with and I'm here to help. So if I look like a friendly face and you need to talk, send me a message. I'm willing to talk. All right, let's get to bagging. All right, so then we let you do 10 minutes. So I wasn't gonna video all of my day getting in my milk, but Here we go. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 ounces in like 36 hours. 36 hours. That is it.

But I don't freeze it all together because I do like to keep some in the fridge for easy access every now and then. So I've got the Medela breast milk, not storage bags, they're great. And you just see I'm pouring it straight in there, nice and easy. And then after this I have to push all of the air out because nobody likes frozen air bubbles in their milk because they're annoying. So, yep, writing the date and amount there. And 2 ounces, nice and ready to be frozen. And that's the fridge stash, just a little one. And that is."

Today I tried to give y'all better lighting, but it was just not working out because it's a gloomy day. Okay. Also, I try to separate my morning and night milk, but I think I'm over there. I'm over it for real. Like, yesterday, I literally messed up and poured night milk into the morning milks. So after that, I was like, you know what? Separating this is too much anyway. Hell, we already know. Pumping and making bottles and doing all that is already a job. Trying to separate and keep up with what I did at night, what I did in the evening, what I did in the morning. Baby, look. No, ma'am. So we got about 6 ounces from the right boob this morning, and I breastfed her on this boob this morning before her bottle got warm. So I know that one definitely won't be as much. Sometimes they're equal, sometimes they're not. No worries. But you're safe over here because this I'm not over producer. That was 2 ounces, by the way. Ain't nobody's over producer. I pump. We're gonna get it a little swoosh around. Okay, so both of these are actually kind of equal in size, believe it or not. And they're both about 37, 38 ounces. So she only does six bottles. So I'm gonna feel six bottles, and then I'll put the rest in bag. I am going to go ahead and keep it separate since I have it separate kind of for now. But yeah, yeah, I think. I think this did. Which I think because I literally don't have time for that. Do y'all be saying other moms, like, separate milk or moms, do y'all separate y milk or it don't matter. Like I said, keeping up with the demand of breast pumping and putting it in bottles and bags and stuff is enough in itself. Who needs extra pressure of morning? And that's why I ain't got time. Cuz just right then I start putting day milk in a night bottle. I ain't got time. I do not have time for that. So I feel her bottles to 4 ounces, even though in one sitting she only drinks, like, three. I do four just in case her wake window is a little longer and she starts to cluster fe it.","The PRESSHA of breastmilk. üôÉ make bottles and store milk w/me. #fyp #momsoftiktok #breastfedingmomprobs #makebottleswithme  So today I'm gonna give y'all a little mommy footage so y'all can do bottles and bags with me.

I am loving these questions you guys have and I am so excited to help you guys out. All the information that I will be sharing today will be pulled up on the screen. They are from reputable websites so you can trust this information. So there's two ways to safely thaw out breast milk and that would be putting it in the fridge for 12 hours prior to using. Or you can put it in a warm bowl of water or running warm water over it. The ideal temperature would be 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not put the breast milk on the counter to defrost. You don't want it to defrost at room temperature. Do the warm water or put it in the fridge. A lot of people might be thinking why can't I use the microwave? The best way I can describe it is if you are drinking a very hot cup of coffee, you're going to burn your throat. So if you put it in the microwave it could heat it up too much, it can create hot spots and it can burn your baby's throat and that's not something that you want. If you defrosting the breast milk to be used, you need to use it two hours after it is defrosted. If you are defrosting the breast milk just to have it be sit in the fridge, you can have that in the fridge for 24 hours and then it needs to be discarded. As I stated in my last video, you cannot, I repeat cannot refreeze breast milk. And just to answer any questions on why you can't refreeze it, it will further break down the nutrients and increase the risk of bacterial growth. So it's just it's risk that you want to take. So do not refreeze it. If you are not going to use it after it is thawed out, just discard it and I really hope that this helps. If you have any more questions about pumping, about breastfeeding, about storing milk, anything like that, I would love to help. So leave them down in the comments and I will try to answer the best of my abilities.","Reply to @rachyjayne1 I hope this helps #milkstorage #storage #breastmilk #breastfeedingthoughts #pumpingmom #pumpinglife #pumpingmama #pumping This question.

One of the things that is important to remember is that if you've just pumped your milk, you can leave it out for a few hours. But if you know that you're going to just be storing it anyway, put it directly into the fridge to cool down. Once it's cooled in the fridge, then you can put it in the freezer.

But there was one case where an infant was severely disabled because of some improper hygiene practices. And I'm going to tell you why this case happened. In 2016, the baby was born at 29 weeks and at 21 days old, developed sepsis, which is a bloodstream infection. Now, I want you to keep in mind this baby was very, very premature. The baby was found to have a Cronobacter infection, which was found on the mom's breast pump parts and 11 of her frozen breast milk bags. Now, the baby was having seizures, had a really bad infection, had brain necrosis, and was left disabled. When the mom was asked about her cleaning practices, she told them that she would soak the parts in warm, soapy, not scrub them, and then just air dry and use again. So no sterilization.

Today I want us to talk about things that I don't love about exclusively pumping. Number one, having to wash pump parts at the end of the day. And bottles are used throughout the day. I use a pitcher method. But the way I use my pitcher method is like, is that I collect all milk in storage bottles and put them in the fridge every time I pump. And at the end of the day I fill my jar with all the milk. Number two, having scheduled pump sessions, it's very hard to be on schedule, especially now that I am back at work. Sometimes you find that we are very busy at work. I just can't leave and go and pump. So sometimes I stretch up until five or six hours before I pump. But I make sure when I'm at work I pump three times on my 12 hour shift. But it's very stressful to know that I am missing a pump session. I would want to do whatever I'm doing quickly, quickly. And then I, I, I have to quickly crush and pump. And sometimes when I'm here at home, you find that I want to sleep and like rest. I can't rest because why in an hour time, it's my next pumping session. At night, sometimes I have to wake up feeling engaged, have to go to pump. My life revolves around pumping and it's very stressful. It's draining, it's exclusively pumping is not for the week. To all mothers who wish to exclusively pump, be ready. Because sometimes I do break down. I do feel like crying. I wanted to quit so many times. But at the end of the day I remind myself why I had to exclusively pump and the benefits of breast milk to my child. Another thing that I don't like about exclusively pumping. And I think it also affects those who are breastfeeding as well. Their hunger, their thirst. Good. Every time when I finish pumping, it's like I must replace the food. I must replace the milk that I removed with with food. Like a lot of food, I can binge eat after each and every pump. Or I must make sure that I have a snack after each pump. The hanger that comes with producing milk is, it's insane. I do wake up sometimes at night for a snack, but luckily I'm not gaining any weight. Like it helped me a lot with losing weight. And another thing, it is not that cheap because yes, you can buy a pump, but you must replace the pump part. You must replace the pump parts. I always buy because I have oversupply. I always buy storage bags. Like I can use like 100 storage bags. So I must always buy them. And the ones I buy now it's 120, meaning it's I buy. I usually buy four a month for boxes of them. Meaning it's 120 times four. And when the palm pads are worn out, I must replace them. And it's another money though it's not that expensive than buying formula. But it's not cheap exclusively pumping is not cheap. Another thing, me as an over supplier. I must have enough bottles to store the milk inside inside the fridge. Because I pump store in the fridge and fill up my pitcher later.","Pumping is not for the weak.it requires dedication and commitment but ive fallen in love with all that comes with it and im enjoying every bit#breastfeedingworkingmom #breastfeeedingtips #lactation #exclusivepumping #pumpsessions #powerpumpingmama #pitchermethod #breastmilk #milkstorage #exclusivelybreastfeeeding  Hello mummies.

I try to go by the CBC recommendations most of the time. So freshly pumped milk, so you just pumped it new, is good at room temperature for four hours, it's good in the fridge for four days, then it's good in the freezer for they say best for six months, 12 months is acceptable. So for a year I've also heard six months in your regular freezer and 12 months in the deep freezer. Then once it's frozen and you thaw it out, you can thaw it out and get it to room temperature and it's good at room temperature for two hours, you can thaw it out and leave it in the fridge and it's good in the fridge for 24 hours. So a whole day. And then once it's been thawed, you can't refreeze it. And then the last recommendation they have is once baby comes into contact with the milk. So if you put it in a bottle, once they start eating it, if they don't finish their bottle, it's good for two hours still. So let's say baby starts eating at 8:00, at 10:00, if they're not finishing it at 10:00, you need to throw it away. That being said, I'm hard and fast on some of those rules and I'm more lenient on others because honestly, there's it right at four days, it's not automatically spoiled. So some of the recommendations I will give and take on, some I won't. The ones I don't mess with are the when he's eating a bottle, I will only use it for two hours because once it comes into contact with their mouth, there's more bacteria. And then for me personally, if I thaw out frozen milk, I will not use it past 24 hours because a lot of the time my fresh milk sits in the fridge for four days before I even put it in the freezer. So it's already at least four days old when I unthaw it. But that's different for everybody. If you freeze your milk at one day, right after you pump it and then thaw it out, I could see why you would use it for more than 24 hours in your fridge. But I personally, those are the two rules I don't mess with. But then, like I said, milk doesn't just automatically spoil at these certain marks. So you have to do what's best for you. You have to smell it, taste it, and decide what you think is best for your baby.","Replying to @angiie40123 these are the recommendations i go by and what i do for me and my son! ü•∞ happy breastfeeding #breastfeedingmom #momsoftiktok #milkstoragetips #breastmilk #cdcguidelines #frozenmilk #freezerstash Hey guys, it's 6:20 and I'm doing my morning pump and clearly I slept too long between bumps, but I wanted to answer this question.

You have to smell it, taste it, and decide what you think is best for your baby."

You guys have a lot of really good questions about the pitcher method. So I'm going to try and answer a few of them, starting with this one. Okay, so technically I have until 1 5pm that would be four days of this picture before I have to freeze the milk. A lot of you asked why I put PM on the bag if I'm mixing it all together. The reason is because I just need to know if I the first pump in the picture was my nighttime pump or my early pump. So I know when to when I've reached that four days. So I could technically put the milk from last night's pump, this morning's pump, and even tonight's pump into this pitcher. Because I will, I have up until then to when I reach that four day mark and the milk has to be frozen. But if you remember, everything that I pour into this pitcher becomes as old as the oldest milk in the pitcher. So whatever I pour into this has to be frozen by tonight. This is already a lot of milk to freeze. So instead I'm just going to stop pouring into this pitcher now and I'm going to start a fresh pitcher. This is my hilariously large pitcher. It really doesn't need to be this big, but it's the other one that I have. Okay, so every time you start a new pitcher, I get a milk bag and put the date on it so that I remember. Because, remember, you're not gonna remember, even though you think you might. And the first milk I'm gonna put in here is the milk that I pumped last night, which is 14:24pm this little baby just woke up. Okay, so here's last night's pump. A lot of people were very concerned that I was mixing AM and PM milk. Here's this morning. So technically I think that there's a little bit of a difference. There's like some melatonin in the nighttime milk and that sort of stuff. But really the effects of the different times that you pump breast milk and those effects on the baby have actually never been studied. And kind of the consensus is that if there is a difference, it's pretty negligible. And you get more of a benefit from mixing all the fat and the watery stuff together so that the bottles are more even. So that's why the pitcher method has gotten really popular. You can totally have a morning pitcher and a night pitcher if you want. But because I only pump twice a day, like really make sense for me to do that. Also, I can't do this right now. Cuz I don't have two hands, but this is one of those butt paste appliers. This has never touch touched a baby's butt in my house. But I do use this to scrape the fat off the sides of the bottles because that's like the really good stuff. That's what makes the picture method worth it. So I have my new pitcher started. Now I have four days to fill this in from last night and I'm going to pour tonight's bottle out of this and go ahead and freeze everything in freezer bags and we'll start fresh. I hope this made sense.","Replying to @outdoors jess #pitchermethod #pumpingmom #pumping #milkstorage #milkstoragetips #newmom #newmomtips  This is a really good question.

I need to talk about my labor and delivery job, though, because it is just so fun. So if you, like, haven't been seeing my videos, I just started work part time, actually. I will be ecb, which means I have to work. I think it's like, 36 hours a month, technically. I've really just been, like, showing, like, my pumping journey, trying to figure that out. And it's been going a lot better, honestly, than it was so chaotic. I'm going to have to, like, cut this so many times because I'm just, like, still kind of trying to hurry because I'm not 100% sure where I'm going for this class. I mean, I have the address, but I've just never been there before. One of those people who gets really red, by the way, when you put on, like, when you touch your face often, like, when I wash my face, it's so red afterwards. So I always feel like I do way too much blush. And then, like, 30 minutes later, when I'm already, like, gone most of the time out of the house, I'm like, oh, that looks like I'm not wearing any blush at all. Nice. If you don't know what I do exactly. I am a certified surgical technologist, which means that I am working with your doctor with your delivery, like, along with the nurses, obviously. But basically me and your doctor are the ones that are scrubbed in, actually, like, working down, getting the baby out. And, well, we're mainly just, like, passing them stuff. And we take care of the placenta, we take care of, like, the cord. We get the cord blood samples, and we take care of, like, all the setup for your delivery as well as, like, for your C sections, too. Yeah, that's basically the gist of what I do. I love it. It has been so fun. I really feel like this is just, like, exactly where I'm supposed to be. And I do miss Noeli still so much. This is, like, going into my third week of working, and I still have my story the same amount. So I don't know if that's when that'll get better or what. But I will say having something that is, like, I really am this passionate about and have been really enjoying the people that I'm working with that have been training me, that makes it, honestly, I think, a lot easier. I'm out of my Ilia mascara, which is my favorite one. But this one is, like, literally the cheapest thing ever. I'm sure you've seen it the Essence Lash. And I don't remember what this color means, but this is the one that I buy, the teal kind. I bought it like, a few times because it's just so cheap. I cannot talk while I put on mascara. I didn't realize, though, that when I switched, like, bags that it didn't fit onto my manual hand pump. So thankfully, my hospital, they provide, like, those big Medela, like the wheelie car. I don't know exactly. My cats are being insane. Anyway, so thankfully there was a lactation consultant that I found, and she's lovely and helped me get that all set up. So I'm gonna. I think. I think I'm gonna try and keep using that because I will say I think it takes a little bit longer, but I get more out, like when I'm hand pumping. Hold on. When I was hand pumping, I was only getting a certain amount out, which at first I was like, oh, it's probably. You know, this is probably just as much as I can get out. Because I nursed her and I know exactly what I would get all the time. And then yesterday I was hooked up to this, you know, little fancy, smanchy machine and I got more than I had before while pumping anyways. But I think that's all, like, kind of the chit chat for now about my new job. It sucks that I can't talk, like, more about my job because you just, like, obviously can't talk about certain scenarios with people and their babies. So I do feel like it's going to be a really good fit. I do have about, like, three more weeks. Four more weeks of orientation, I think. So I just got done with my BLS class and I just pumped in my car. I've never pumped in the car ever. And honestly, like, there wasn't a good spot. I don't know this building well. So I decided to just pump in my car. And I don't think I'll ever do it again because even though I am, like, kind of far out, I'm just, like, looking around, making sure. Because my husband's car, I don't think his windows are tinted at all. So anyways, going to the class was later than I think it was supposed to be too, so. Because people were already getting there for the next class and I don't know, it ran longer than I thought it would. I have to get gas or I'm not gonna make it to my work. So gonna grab gas. And then hopefully I didn't miss all the fun this morning.","Chatty lil work vlogüíï #workvlog #workingmom #workingmomsclub #healthcareworkercheck #laboranddelivery #laboranddeliverycst #landdcst #cst #scrubtech #obtech #laboranddeliveryscrubtech #pumping #learningtopump #pumpingmama #pumpingatwork #pumpingvlog #breastfeedingmama #breastfedbaby #firsttimemama #newmama #goingbacktowork  Today before work, I have to go to a basic life support class.

So good morning. Drives me nuts. Anyways, so it's already 11am and we were up pretty late last night. Alex took today off of work too, so he'll be home all day. So we were kind of just hanging out watching TikTok videos. Get out. I don't want him in. It's nice having him home, except for when I'm trying to film a video. Benny's a pain in my ass. Now the dog's barking. I can't stand it. Anyways, I don't know what we're doing today other than my little cousin has a softball game. I don't know. But first, before we do anything, I've got to pump. Okay. Got my massagers. Turn these on right now. They take like two to three minutes to heat up fully. So it has, like, different settings, different colors for different settings, but red is the hottest. That's what I prefer. And it takes like two to three minutes. So if I get these on now, let the dog in and get my things hooked up and ready to go, they'll be ready to go too. So let's go pop. All right. I just overflowed on my right, so gotta switch these out. My left is at, like, 9:50. My right's probably at 12. I already went ahead and labeled some bags. I still have milk in my pitcher from yesterday, and I still have, like four or five bottles filled from yesterday. So I'm just gonna go ahead and bag this for now. And then I'm gonna have to bag my pitcher milk before we leave so I can get my pitcher washed and cleaned. Alex and the baby are already, like, ready to go, and little do they know I still have to pump again. And we have bottles, pump parts, and my picture that I still have to do before we leave the house. So they're gonna definitely be getting impatient by the time I'm ready to go. Perfect. So that was, like, perfect. 12 ounces on the right. And I just realized I was looking out my back door. I also need to water my plants. So when my mom and my grandma and we went to the nursery a couple weeks ago, I got a rose bush, two of these, like, purple, purple flowers, a bleeding heart plant, bush thing, and a big tomato plant. It's like a porch plant, a porch tomato plant. I don't know if that makes sense. It's like a little cherry tomato. So you don't have to plant it in the ground. It's just in a big pot on our back porch. But I cannot keep any plants alive. I've tried to garden. I tried to plant stuff. So I'm trying really hard this time to keep these alive, but I already keep forgetting to water them, so I have to do that before we leave. All right, so there's only 4 ounces left in this. So that's just gonna go into a bottle. And then I bagged three ounce. No, three bags of six ounces. So I'm gonna go back to pumping after I put these in the freezer. And then once I'm done pumping, I'm gonna bag whatever I pumped and what's left in my refrigerator from my picture from yesterday. All right, I just finished pumping. I got, like, five and a half on my left and five on my right. So now I'm going to bag this. I'm trying to keep track of how many ounces I've been pumping because I know my supply has taken, like, a major dip right now since being sick and not pumping as often, But I'm trying to keep track so that I don't know. I feel like if I see how much I'm pumping, then I feel more motivated to pump again. Like, if I don't, I'm like, I've pumped enough today, but I see, like, I pump 50 ounces, but I want to raise my supply to 70 ounces, I'll feel more, like, motivated to pump again. So I use the Huckleberry app to keep track of all my pumps and how many ounces I do. So trying to keep track today because I've been really bad about it the past few days. All right, so another bag of 6 ounces, and I'm gonna put this in the freezer real quick and then grab my pitcher and bag the rest of that. And my amazing, wonderful husband Jim Bob is doing the dishes. I've been stuck on, like, duggar TikTok, like, 19 kids and counting. And I think that this week, their new documentary, it's called Very Shiny People or something, is coming out, and I'm really excited for it. Jim Bob. Love them. Jim Bob's the dad. But in the beginning of every episode, she's like, hi, I'm Michelle, and this is my husband, Jim Bob. And these are 19 kids. I could probably name them all, but I don't know if I could do them in order. That was like, an old obsession. But then at the very end, she would be like, in our latest, newest, precious addition, Josie. All right, let me put this in the freezer and grab my pitcher. All right, now I got my pitcher out, so you really shouldn't Mix like warm and cold milk. It's not recommended. Some people do whatever again, decide what's best for your kid. But since I'm just bagging it and freezing it immediately, I'm not worried about it. I feel like it really only matters if you have like. Like my milk straight from my boob is warm and then this is cold. So if I like continually throughout the day was adding my warm, freshly pumped milk in with the cold milk, it would keep raising the temperature of the cold milk. So then all of the milk in this pitcher would keep going from like warm to cold to warm to cold again. Yeah. Let me see it. I ordered this from Amazon. It was like one of those little Amazon deals, little kids suction plate. But I like that it had the three different sections and the spoon. I think I got it for $3. If you're not already, make sure you're following my Instagram because I keep posting all of the Amazon deals and promo codes on my Instagram stories because I don't want to cloud my TikTok and annoy everybody with a bunch of heels. But there are some good ones. I got that. And then I also this super cute little sippy cup and it was like three bucks. It came with this straw. It's like silicone. And my son's only four and a half months old and we handed it to him and he was like holding it and chewing on the straw. So I'm excited for when we start giving him like baby food and do baby led weaning. Probably start that honestly in June, in a couple weeks. So I'm excited because I think he'll get the hang of that pretty quickly. Another bag of 6 ounces. Alright, so there was 4 ounces in that one. So I'll bag this last bag of 6 ounces. I actually labeled the perfect amount of bags. And then once we wash the bottles here in a second. Alex just finished the dishes. Now he's gonna wash my pump parts and bottles. But once he's done washing some bottles, I'll toss that milk into a new bottle. So Alex, do the math. Ready? 32. All right, so I pumped 32 ounces this morning and I bagged all of it, I think, except for this, which this was actually from the picture. We should be good to go. But anyways, we're gonna try to be productive and get some shit done so we can get out of the house soon. So Alex can get his hair cut because look at him, he needs it.","Just another chaotic morning in the Hoban House todayü§™ #spectras1 #pumpingmom #pumpingmama #milk #breastmilk #liquidgold #milkstorage #breastmilkstorage #breastmilkbybottle  Good morning. So good morning. Drives me nuts. Anyways, so it's already 11am and we were up pretty late last night. Alex took today off of work too, so he'll be home all day. So we were kind of just hanging out watching TikTok videos. Get out. I don't want him in. It's nice having him home, except for when I'm trying to film a video. Benny's a pain in my ass. Now the dog's barking. I can't stand it. Anyways, I don't know what we're doing today other than my little cousin has a softball game. I don't know. But first, before we do anything, I've got to pump. Okay. Got my massagers. Turn these on right now. They take like two to three minutes to heat up fully. So it has, like, different settings, different colors for different settings, but red is the hottest. That's what I prefer. And it takes like two to three minutes. So if I get these on now, let the dog in and get my things hooked up and ready to go, they'll be ready to go too. So let's go pop. All right. I just overflowed on my right, so gotta switch these out. My left is at, like, 9:50. My right's probably at 12. I already went ahead and labeled some bags. I still have milk in my pitcher from yesterday, and I still have, like four or five bottles filled from yesterday. So I'm just gonna go ahead and bag this for now. And then I'm gonna have to bag my pitcher milk before we leave so I can get my pitcher washed and cleaned. Alex and the baby are already, like, ready to go, and little do they know I still have to pump again. And we have bottles, pump parts, and my picture that I still have to do before we leave the house. So they're gonna definitely be getting impatient by the time I'm ready to go. Perfect. So that was, like, perfect. 12 ounces on the right. And I just realized I was looking out my back door. I also need to water my plants. So when my mom and my grandma and we went to the nursery a couple weeks ago, I got a rose bush, two of these, like, purple, purple flowers, a bleeding heart plant, bush thing, and a big tomato plant. It's like a porch plant, a porch tomato plant. I don't know if that makes sense. It's like a little cherry tomato. So you don't have to plant it in the ground. It's just in a big pot on our back porch. But I cannot keep any plants alive. I've tried to garden. I tried to plant stuff. So I'm trying really hard this time to keep these alive, but I already keep forgetting to water them, so I have to do that before we leave. All right, so there's only 4 ounces left in this.

It's very light, it's small, and it even comes with a USB charger. You're gonna also need some breast milk storage bags, an insulated cooler with an ice pack or ice packs. Once your breast is stored safely inside of your insulated cooler, it is good for up to 24 hours in that cooler.

Get an insulated cooler bag, ice pack, milk storage bags, Sharpie markers, a mobile breast pump, a portable cleaning brush, dish soap, and something to cover up with when you nurse or pump. Because I had all of these supplies, I was able to pump mid flight and make it to my destination safely. When booking a hotel, I'm always sure to book a hotel that has a refrigerator in my room so that I'm able to store my breast milk and get it back home safely. Next, you'll need to look up the local dry ice supplier so that you can freeze your milk and get it back home safely. There are several ways to dry ice your milk, but you can check out my mommy blog@shekasweetie.com for more details on that. You'll definitely be able to get your milk through TSA with no problem. They may look at you crazy, but don't worry, you'll be fine. I was able to pump just before my flight, add it to my stash and get it on the plane with no problem. Some airports are super thoughtful. They have nursing rooms for mommies like you and me. I took advantage of this during my layover and was able to add it to my stash stash. And now I'm heading home. I hope this helps.","Happy Breastfeeding month mamas. Here‚Äôs how I travel with my breastmilk to ensure I get my milk back home safely.

The hot water kills potential bacteria in powdered formula. Let the water cool slightly before adding it to the bottle, but it should be at least 158 degrees when the powdered formula is added. This is to kill the bacteria. I'm making 2 ounces of formula here, so I add 2 ounces of water first to the bottle, making sure it's level, and then one scoop of leveled but not packed formula per the directions on the formula can. Then you can swirl or stir the formula to make sure it's totally dissolved. This is a good alternative to vigorously shaking, which can cause air bubbles and gas. Test the formula on your wrist to be sure it's cooled before feeding it to your baby.","How to safely prepare a bottle of infant formula #infantformula #whattoexpect #informedisbest #feedingbabies #pregnantmama #breastfeedingclass Hey guys, I'm Rebecca and I'm here to show you how to safely prepare a bottle of infant formula.

The simplest way to do this is using a dishwasher on sanitize setting‚Äîa sterilizer is not necessary! #fedisbest #formulamoms #formulamom #formulafeeding #formulamomma #formulaisfood ","So I just came across a post, well actually several posts in a formula feeding Facebook group that compelled me to make a video. In the post, someone was asking if it's necessary to buy a. Well, either buy a bottle sterilizer like the steam ones, or if it's necessary to boil the bottles in order to sterilize them after, you know, every use or every so often, whatever. They were asking about that and there were a lot of people in the comments saying, yes, you have to. It's super important. It's important if they're preemie immunocompromised, if they're newborns, you have to have a sterilizer. So, so then I looked up sterilizer and like, you know, sterilizing bottles and there were a lot of people saying the same thing and this is actually not true. So first there's a difference between sanitizing and sterilizing. Sanitizing reduces the amount of microorganisms to a level that is considered safe. Sanitizing doesn't kill the germs, but it removes them from the surface, which significantly lowers the risk of infection. You'll usually hear claims like removes 99.9% of germs. So it removes most of them, not all of them. But it's, it's to a point that's considered safe, that is sanitizing. Sterilization on the other hand, eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, 100% of it, including bacteria and spores. When it comes to infant feeding items, usually we're talking about bottles. The only time this is necessary or recommended is after the initial purchase of the bottle or nipples or any bottle parts, any feeding items after you first purchase it. And it'll typically say this on the insert too, or somewhere on the package that it's recommended to sterilize it before you use it for the first time. Beyond that, daily sanitizing is recommended per the CDC anyways. The CDC recommends it for preemies, immunocompromised babies or babies under the age of 2 months. It's not generally necessary according to the CDC for older healthy babies. The EAAP doesn't have as strict guidelines. They say that you can sanitize with a dishwasher, but also that hand washing with hot soapy water, correctly letting it air dry, is sufficient to kill most germs. The easiest, the simplest way to sanitize, at least in my opinion, is with a dishwasher, washing it on the sanitized setting, you know, the heated drying cycle, quick and easy. I know, most people will just toss them in at the end of the day and then they're clean and sanitized and ready to go by morning. Now if you're like me and you don't have a dishwasher, I had a healthy full term baby so I never bothered with sanitizing my bottles. But if you do want to for your baby or if it's recommended for your baby, then you'll typically need to either do the boiling method or using one of those steam sterilizer. In those cases you are sterilizing the bottles which is totally fine. I mean there's nothing wrong with even more protection. But per the cdc, sanitizing daily is what's recommended for babies who are at the, you know, highest risk for infection or illness. So yeah, if you are not wanting to shell out the money for a sterilizer or you've been sterilizing and you're tired of it, don't want to do it and you have a dishwasher, then congrats, you don't have to sterilize. It's not necessary.","Per the CDC, sanitizing feeding items daily is recommended for babies who are premature, immunocompromised or under 2 months of age.

And then I will separate the fuller containers into increments of 4 once I get these two empty. And then I have my little buddy with me. Jay. Good job. Good job. So these are the two bags of 4 ounces. I'm gonna label it with the date that I pumped and three months from now, which is the minimum that they last in the freezer and the amount of ounces that it is. So the 4 ounces, okay. So I started separating them by increments of 4. I always have to fill this one up. So I'm gonna start doing that just to speed up the process a little bit. Okay, so is 23 bags of 4 ounces worth of milk in each bag. So altogether this is 92 ounces of milk over the past about two days. And then I left the two ounce container on the side. Okay, it cut off. But I left a 2 ounce milk container on the side for when she wants a bottle in case, you know, I don't want to feed her later off of my breast. And Steven wants to do that. So I always leave like a little bit of milk aside in the fridge, just in. So this is what it looks like after I freeze my milk. And you lay it flat. So that way you have as much storage as possible and it prevents holes in the bag when you go to defrost it. This is 70 ounces worth of milk that I pumped. And altogether I have been pumping for a total of about a week now, maybe a little bit less because I had her on the 16th of September. And my milk fully comes in around the third day. So really only a few days I've been pumping and this is how much I've managed to get. And this is how I label it. So pumped on 9, 22. I put that it lasts until about December 22nd. 4 ounces. Technically your milk lasts in the freezer for 6 to 12 months. So these are technically good until March. But I just put the minimum for my peace of mind. At room temperature, they're good for up to four hours. And again, you can keep them for up to six to 12 months in a regular freezer, maybe even longer in a deep freezer.

The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk. And some people say it adds, like, more electrolytes. So if you go longer without pumping, your body is thinking, like, this baby's dehydrated. It hasn't drank in a long time, so it creates more of that foremilk with more electrolytes. It's really watery to hydrate them, so it makes sense. But I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I just read that Alex is interested. I don't know if you guys are, but I don't even know if I, like, went full circle with that. But the whole point was that, like, when you have an oversupply, you usually have an oversupply of, like, your thinner foremilk, not your fattier hind milk. And sometimes it can be harder to get that hind milk out because you have to fully pump until you're fully empty to pull that out. So when I'm feeling better, I'll Do a video. I've done it before. I've done it before. But, like, I'll pump for five minutes and show my milk, and then pump for another five minutes, show that milk, pump for five, until I have no milk left. And you can clearly see my milk grow from, like, very watery, almost translucent, like, very thick and creamy, and, like, more golden, liquid gold. Hold on, let me wash this. All right, I'm back. The baby is, like, fighting Alex. He does not feel good. It's breaking our hearts. Hate it so much. And I don't know if I went full circle in my video this morning either, about, like, why I even had, like, a panic attack this morning, but it's because when he got readmitted for jaundice, that was, like, so scary. Seeing him in that incubator, not being able to breastfeed him when he was in the, like, little baby container. We couldn't take him out at all. So here I am, postpartum for one week, first time, mom, and you basically take my baby out of my arms. Like, it was a very scary situation. The nurses, like, all came rushing and literally grabbed him from my arms, put him in this thing, ripped his clothes off, like, had his eyes, like, basically taped shut. And, like, anytime he was crying, we weren't allowed to pick him up. So it was. It was, like, torturous. Like, if you want to drive someone insane, put a new mother in a room with a crying baby that they're not allowed to pick up. Like, that felt so, like, inhumane and just scary and sad. I just sat there and, like, cried literally the whole night we were there. I mean, not to make this a whole, like, video on jaundice, but that was very scary. And we just sat next to his little thing the whole night with just, like, one hand in there, holding his hand, talking to him. But it was heartbreaking. So I'm so scared to take him back to the hospital right now with him being sick, because I'm scared we'll get admitted, they'll take him from me or something. I don't know. On the other hand, if he is sick enough and needs to go to the hospital, I will, without a doubt, take him. But I also know there's not a lot they can do for babies who are only four months old. He doesn't have a fever. He's really just congested and fussy. So we're just making sure he's still eating good, he's breathing fine, all of those things. So we're still just doing the humidifier. Steaming them out in some hot showers and warm baths. Lots of bottles, lots of cuddles. Some Tylenol. I've been checking his fever periodically. He doesn't have one. We did the nose, Frida, for the first time. Disgusting. But we got a lot out. All right, so here's all of his bottles. It had to take a brief intermission. The baby got upset and just wanted his mama. So I went and finished feeding him his bottle and gave him some more medicine. Got him settled down and I got my bags labeled, which. This is not gonna be enough. No, not at all. Oh, well."," Hi guys. So I am still sick. The baby is still sick, but we're chugging along. So my like milk management video that I normally do on Thursday night, it's going to look a little different. So I still haven't heard from the milk bank on if my milk has passed or failed. And I think today is day, business day 13, I think. And I thought it was eight to 10 days, but it's actually eight to 15 business days, I guess. So I guess if I don't hear tomorrow then I should hear by Monday. I don't know. This is my first box, my first time doing it, so I'm extra anxious and I've never done it before, so I don't really know. I did hear back about the lactation cookies. I knew there was a chance that I couldn't donate my milk while I was eating those. But again, this is like my first round of donating my milk, so I'm still learning and I reached out to the milk bank that they just to be safe, they don't want me to donate my milk during that period and they also want me to do seven days washout from the time I ate the last cookies. So the last time I ate the cookie I think was Sunday or Monday. I have it in my emails with them. So I have to wait until next week to donate, which I wasn't too worried about because thought we were going on our trip. So I was like, it's fine. It was going to be on my trip anyways. I wasn't going to donate any milk. Now we're not going to our trip. So now I'm just missing a week. So I just pumped this. Also, my supply has dropped significantly since being sick. This was my right, this was my left. That was like 30 minutes of pumping. I pumped this this morning and I didn't have like a nipple to go with it. So I've got to do something with that first. Then these were for my other pump later in the day. And then this was still from yesterday. So I have like way too much milk. I saw three bottles in the refrigerator, but I'm gonna use my milk to fill up some bottles and I do think this milk probably has some antibodies in it. So I think I am going to bag this. Even though I previously said it wasn't going to bag any more milk. I think I am going to. So let's put this into two bottles. All right, so there's two bottles then give this a good shake. Actually, I'm just gonna bag this because I nursed my son earlier. So this will have been milk from after I nursed him him. So I'll do that instead, hopefully. I do think that after I nursed him, this milk was a lot thicker and, like, fattier. This a good time to put in my video. So I don't normally have, like, fatty milk plugs or anything. And I'm always so jealous of everyone else's that I see on here until I have a sick and my son's sick and I'm nursing him, and I had, like, the best milk plug I've ever had in my entire life, probably ever will. My milk. I feel like my milk is always so, like, thin. Like, it's always very watery. It wasn't at first, but, like, now it is because of having such a big oversupply. Like, usually if you have, like, a major oversupply. I know everyone thinks having an oversupply is just the greatest thing. It's not. When you have major oversupply, you have, like, foremilk and hindmilk. You usually have a lot more foremilk, and that is your, like, thinner milk. The longer you go without pumping, your body makes more foremilk. Your foremilk. I've seen, like, contradicting stuff. I'm talking to you guys, and I'm talking to Alex. There's, like, contradicting evidence. Some people say, like, no matter what your foremilk or your hind milk, it's all your milk. But your milk that's in the back of your breast, your hind milk has higher fat content. Your milk in the front of your breast has lower fat content. That's your fore milk.

I just prefer this method because I just need this much room, like this much room in my freezer versus a whole area where I have to lay every single one of them flat. And I think this holds 12. Yeah, it holds 12 of them. And milk stays unfrozen in the fridge good for about four to six days. So after those four to six days, I start to freeze them and that's what I do.

I had a killer day pumping yesterday. In all honestly, in all honestly, in all honesty, like you can't see because the level of milk goes above the line of like the pitcher lid. But I think I did like a solid 32 ounces. Maybe, maybe 31 and a half. But like it's up there. I am like really, really itching to get out of the house right now. Yesterday you'll see like I talked about it on a different video when I make my breakfast. But like yesterday I had a really rough day and I'm like really, really extroverted and I'm someone who just needs to leave the house every single day. Like I cannot stay cooped up inside. And I think that's partially what is getting to me right now is that I'm never leaving. Well, like I leave sometimes but not enough, not enough for me to like be sane. I need to participate in society. Like that's, that's what it comes down to. I need to participate in society. I need to be out in the world. I need, I need to see people that I do not breastfeed. So I'm not going to go wild. I think I'm just going to like go to Dunkin Donuts and go through the drive thru. I mean somewhere to get a coffee. Either Duncan, Starbucks or Bigby. I do like Big B coffee a lot. Maybe we'll do Big B because I've also never tried an ice drink from Big B before. I've only gotten hot drinks. But I like Duncan cuz Duncan has so many deals in their app. Like Baby has coupons too but it's like for drinks, for like coffee drinks. And my husband is a big coffee drinker and I like that at Dunkin you can like get yourself a drink and get like a free donut or something. And so I get my drink and my husband gets a donut. Okay, so here are all his bottles for the day. This is enough for eight bottles. I make six. Six of these right now I have made and then this is enough for two more. So when he drinks out of one of these and I dump it out and clean it, then I'll pour this into more bottles. The reason I don't make all eight of these bottles is because I only own seven bottles. But that's okay. I ordered more bottles from Amazon. They just take a while to come in. Oh my God, look how much milk I am freezing that is over a cup. This is the cup line right here. It's over a cup. Okay, let's do this quickly, because I can hear Fussy Fussy waking up right now. You hear him? Can you hear him? He keeps making that sound and then going to sleep. So I have a couple more minutes, but I do need to rush. All right, let's see how much. This is perfect. These are not even. I tried to do it. Oh. I tried to do this approximately, evenly.

What do I plan on doing with all my frozen milk since I have high lipase and I don't know if my daughter's gonna take it or not? Honestly, I don't really know. I have. Oh, let me look. See how much milk I have frozen. Okay. I'm estimating here I have about 1400 ounces of milk frozen throughout all of our freezers. We have three freezers in our house. Not in our house, in the garage. And then we have a little bar area that has its own freezer. So that's what I think I have. I did a really bad job keeping track of that this time around with my daughter. So that's just a guess. I have no plans of being away from my daughter for an extended period of time, like days. So I am able to just leave a big pitcher at home that could last four days. And so she could get fresh milk until she's a year old. Cause we plan on giving her breast milk until she's one year. Honestly, that's. Originally what I planned on doing, was just giving my daughter fresh breast milk and then freezing all the rest and sending it to a milk bank. Our closest milk bank is down in Iowa. I live in southern Minnesota, and I have not registered with them. I remember with my last kid when I tried to do that, it was like a lot of testing and all that stuff and having a lot of rules around it and things could have changed. I haven't honestly checked. Okay. But it was things like needing to be alcohol free for 24 hours before having milk you can donate. But I haven't been keeping track that closely, so that makes me a little nervous. And like, do they have rules like, am I leaving it in the fridge too long? Is it something that has to be frozen immediately or that I'm just following certain guidelines? I don't know. So honestly, I just need to reach out to the milk bank so that they can get this milk to NICU's. I think that would be. I'd be really good about that because I do plan on pumping until Luel is a year old. So I'm not worried about running out of milk otherwise. Honestly, if any of you mamas know of anybody in need in the southern Minnesota area, northern Iowa, that's where I'm located. And I would love to just donate it to a family, but just know it stinks a little bit when you thaw it out. Honestly, we are starting to run out of room in all of our freezers to keep all of my milk. I mean, we could reorganize it to make it fit nicer. But I do need to get a game plan with what to do with all this, because we're simply just running out of room.","Replying to @_hay_m what am I going to do with my frozen, stinky milk?? #pumpingmom #overproducer #momsoftiktok #fyp #foryoupage #breastmilk #pitchermethod #pitcher #momcozy #milkbags #milkstorage  Great question.

Happy Friday. This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick. You can just take that out, and it'll be easier to pour off the little bit of milk that's left. So let's see. I was at 8 ounces, so I have like, 3.7. I got like 3.7 ounces on my right side. I'm almost at the 12 ounce mark, but I'm not there yet. With my Boone collection cup, I'm at, like 1.5 ounces on my right side, and now I'm a little over the 12 ounce mark."," Good morning, y'all. Happy Friday. This morning, for my pump session, I used my Bayou Boo wearable pump. I did pump for 30 minutes. And of course, y'all know I love this pump simply because the cushions. This is the depressing side, my right side. So I was about to say, I don't even know which is which, but obviously we know this is my right side. Do y'all see the curves on these pumps? This is why I love it. So this is my left side. On my left side, I got 6 ounces. So this is my collection cup for my left side. I'm almost at the three ounce mark, so I'm just going to pour it in here. Why did I just do it like that? So I'm a little over 8 ounces. Another thing I love about this pump is that so, you know. Well, I'm not sure if y'all experience this, but I experience a lot of my milk or, like, once I finish pumping, I'll have milk stuck in a duct valve. And I'm too lazy to undo the whole pump just to get it out. So with this pump, it gets. It comes up here and I just pick it up like this. I'm not sure if y'all can see. Huh? Let's see. So this how it looks regular. I just pick it up like this. Yeah, y'all can see it. I pick it up like this, and the milk goes down in a little hole, and I just pour it out. So now I'm just going to pour my right side in. So I'm going to show you what I mean by the milk not getting stuck and valve and the duct valve. So up here, you see the milk just gonna. And now it's no milk. Wanna make it more simple. You could really take out. You have the insertion flying insert in there. I love the flying insert. It's so thick.

Let's talk about it. I have been back at work for one month now, and one of my biggest concerns when going back to work was my milk supply and just how to sort of navigate pumping in the office. So I would love to share my experience with you and hopefully it'll help some of you who are going through this transition. So let's talk basics. First of all, it is the law and your right to pump at work. Specifically, you have the right to pump at work for up to one year after your child is born. And your job is required to give you ample break times to do so, as well as a private place to pump without the interference of other employees or the public. And it is not not supposed to be a bathroom space. Now, in my first Going Back to Work video, I had never been in my pumping room, so I didn't know. But my office specifically does have two private pump places that you're able to book for your designated pump time. They have a little chair, a table, a sink, everything that I would need. So if you haven't left for maternity leave yet or you're coming back, make sure you know where your pump room is. One piece of advice that I have that I actually did was before my maternity leave even ended, I quickly logged on and whatever scheduling app you use, we use Outlook. I booked off my pumping time so that no one would be booking me for meetings or anything during my pump times. How do you navigate when to pump? So basically for me, I pump around the time my child will eat. So he currently eats every four hours. I usually feed him around like 5:36am before I leave for work. So I have two pump times at work. I pump at 10am and 2pm and I blocked off a half an hour for each of those times. So whatever works for you is basically whatever your child's feeding time is. Now, what do you do when someone books you over your pumping time? This has happened for me and I have sort of two ways that I navigate it. For me, this is just what works for me. I have like a threshold of 30 minutes. If I need to push my pumping time early by 30 minutes, I can do that. If I need to push it after by 30 minutes, I'm willing to do that. However, once I'm asked to sort of push it by an hour, if someone's really trying to, you know, extend a meeting, let's say from 9:30 to 10:30, that's where I say, no, I can't meet at this time. Please move this meeting. Otherwise I need to be late by 30 minutes. Now, for me, personally, everyone has been respectful of that. I've never been met with anyone upset or angry by this. They're willing to either move the meeting or like I said, if it's within my 30 minute threshold, I'll just pump before or after. But if I ever was to experience anyone sort of getting angry or upset or demanding that I move my pump time for them, then that is something I would recommend that you go to HR for and something that I would definitely go to HR for because it is our right to pump at work and these are the times that we need to do it. So that's too bad. When it comes to pumping at work, I. I'm gonna give you guys the warning that, that I never got. And it's pretty depressing. It's pretty depressing, especially in the beginning because for me, I mean, I would, I would nurse my son and I really enjoyed that bonding and that time that we had. And then when you get back to work, I mean, granted it's emotional going back to work, it's really, really hard. And then that first pumping experience, you're in probably like a smaller room and you're hooked up to your pump and you're just really missing your baby. So that's just something I share because it's probably something you will experience. What I do to help is I look at pictures of him, I look at videos of him, and I just kind of get my mind knowing that, hey, in a few hours I'm gonna be home with him and I'm giving him the milk that he needs. So if you do go back to work and you kind of experience that rush of emotion when you're pumping, know that you're not alone. I was there too. Now I do want to show you guys just kind of products that I use when I pump at work that have helped me. So maybe it'll help you. This is my pumping bag. I bring this to work every day with me. This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can.","Pumping at work, lets talk about it! #pumping #breastfeeding #breastfeeding101 #maternityleave #goingbacktowork #pumpingatwork #maternityleaveover #maternityleaveending #workingmom #workingmoms #breastfeedingproducts #motherhood #motherhoodunplugged #amazonfinds #amazonmusthaves @Babylist @Willow Pump #willowgo #willow @earthmamaorganics #boonnursh @Free People #momsoftiktok #momtok #pumpingtips  Pumping at work.

This bag is from free people. I only say that because so many people asked. It's from free people. I do love it. It's really spacious and has lots of pockets. I put all of my pumping stuff in here. So first I have my willow pump. I use the willow go at work. I know some people get all in a. Get on a fuss about using hands free pumps, but the willow go empties me out really well. I love the suction on it and it works for me. So I bring my willow pump and I bring my Charging cords just because I did have them die on me, which was my own fault. But it's good to know that if they were to die, I can charge them at work if I need to. And I also bring my nipple balm. I use the nipple balm every time I pump. That's just what I do. And I use the Earth Mama brand. I love this nipple balm. It's. It's just Chef's kiss. I wash my dishes each time. I'm. I'm definitely thinking I'm going to transition to just wiping them just because washing them does take a lot of time. But that's what I'm comfortable with. And if you're comfortable with washing them every time, do that. Did buy these breast pump wipes. So if I ever am just in a rush or hurry, I will use these to wipe my pump parts, and then that will hold them over for my next pump session. But when I wash my dishes at work, I got this off Amazon, and it's basically a dishwashing kit. So I'll open it up so you can see. So it comes with this empty canister, and I just put. I put my own dishwasher soap in here, and I use the Dapple dish soap. So I'll literally just pump my dish soap into here so it's in a nice, like, travel case. And then you have all these awesome, just, like, dishwashing tools like this to really, like, clean the bigger parts. You got this little piece to get really in there as well as this one. So I really, really like this. And then it also can be used as a drying rack, so these little spokes you can kind of set down and then, like, rest stuff to dry. I do recommend bringing your own dishwashing stuff. My job does have, like, a communal dish soap and a dish sponge, but I don't want to use that. I don't want Gary's leftovers on my pump hearts. You know what I'm saying? So I do think you should bring your own dishwashing stuff so that you're not, like, contaminating your pump hearts. Then I also have this. Unfortunately, I can't find it on Amazon for you guys, but it is available on Babylist. It is the Boone Trip Travel Kit, I believe it's called. So it comes with the little lawn to put stuff to dry, and then it also comes with this awesome, like, dish scrubber, as well as this little piece to really get in there. I. I really like this one a lot. So look on baby list, if you can't if you're trying to find it. Lastly, I bring a just a drying rag. So this is like a microfiber towel. And I use this to dry my pump parts, mostly because I don't have the time to like actually set them out somewhere and let them air dry. So I use this to to dry my pump parts. Okay, so that is the stuff that I bring. I do have all that, I think most of it linked on my Amazon storefront if you're trying to find it. I swear I'm not trying to like shove my storefront down your throats. It's just it is convenient if you're trying to look for what I'm talking about. So I really hope that that helps you sort of navigating pumping at work. If you guys have any questions, by all means, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help in any way that I can."

It is breastfeeding awareness month, so I want to talk about my breastfeeding journey today just to kind of give maybe a realistic perspective. Breastfeeding was one of the hardest things that I had to learn and that Hallie had to learn as well. She did not latch at the hospital, so we had to supplement with formula. But I wanted to give it my best shot. So one of the tips that the lactation consultant in the hospital gave me was just keep practicing with trying to get your latch. We would sit in the nursery and we would practice the latch and it was really, really like a high stress situation whenever your baby's hungry and you're not able to get her to latch. But in the moment, I just had to stay very calm and just give her the opportunity. I'm like, we're working on this together. And then we follow it up with a bottle. My milk finally came in, like a few days later and I would start pumping. I wasn't producing enough milk in the beginning. Like, feet. She was feeding every single hour and it was exhausting trying to pump every single hour after she fed so I'd have enough milk for the next feed. Like, I just. It was this endless cycle. I just could not catch up. So my two week appointment, my doctor's office actually had a lactation consultant. So as soon as we left that appointment, she latched and became like a pro in just a matter of days. Patient consultant showed me how to properly get her to latch. Like, for the first couple weeks of her latching, it felt like a Texas twister. Like, that's the best way I can explain it. Once we finally two, three, it probably took us three weeks in to finally get to where she could just nurse. I dropped the pumping. If you're nursing and you're able to, like, be home with your baby on maternity leave, drop the pumping. You will build up a stash. You will, I promise. That alone adds so much to it. It's like you feed for 30 minutes and then you pump for 15 or 30 minutes after, and then you're trying to burp the baby and put her to sleep. And it's just once I dropped the pumping and solely exclusively breastfed. That was when, like, it became so joyful to me. It is like our bonding time. I truly believe that, like, it helped my mental health and my healing. I just got so much serotonin from breastfeeding. And I know, like, I don't want to take away the fact that some moms, it just, I think it releases stress hormones in some moms, and it releases good hormones in other moms. So, like, I think that's just what it is, and I think it's just part of your genetics, whether you. Whether you're wired that way or not. So I don't want other moms to feel like you're missing out on something, because if it wasn't fun for you, if you didn't have joy doing it, then you're not missing out. I'm just so glad that I pushed through those first couple weeks, and now it's just, like, it's the best thing in the world for me. So whether you are exclusively breastfeeding, exclusively pumping, or doing a little bit of both, like I am now, because I'm back at work. You should be proud of yourself. Mama's got to go to work.

So let me show you how I make my baby's bottles when we're out and about. So I've got my bottle. I've then got my rapid cool flask. And then I've got my flask with boiling water in there as well. I'm going to fill my bottle up to the 7 ounces with the boiling water. The reason I do it this way is because I find the measurements in rapid cool aren't as accurate. Sorry, we are now at a different angle because there was too many kids running around in the background. Once I've done that, I pour the water into the rapid cool and I always make sure I leave about 1 to 2 ounces left in the bottle. You can see that here. And the reason I do this, I don't have to sterilize the rapid cool every single time I use it. I then give the rapid cool a little shake to activate it. Then I pour the formula powder straight into the bottle because it's got the boiling water in there that will sterilize any of the nasties that you can find in formula powder. I then just give this a little shake around to mix it all up. And then I just pour the boiling water from the rapid cool flour straight back in. It's not boiling anymore. It'll be nice and cool and the bottle will be perfect for baby to drink. This is just a good way of doing it for when you're out and about because you don't have to sterilize the rapid cool every time because it's boiling water going in there every single time. So that will do the steril for you. This just saves me having to clean it all the time and carrying more than one rapid all around with me because they're quite heavy. And then that is baby spot.","How we make our bottles when out and about! #formulafed #babybottles #10monthold #mumtok #tiktokmama #mumsontiktikuk #fyp #foryoupage  In center park.

The fridge hack is used so you don't have to wash your parts every single time. The only thing that goes in the fridge are the milk collection cups. This does not. I keep this separate. It doesn't need to be in the fridge. What's the point of the fridge hack? Like, why wouldn't you just wash your parts in between? Great question. In my classroom, I am nowhere near a sink. We don't have sinks in our classrooms. And my classroom is actually the farthest classroom away from any bathroom or the teacher's lounge. I get about 30 to 40 minutes of prep time. That's enough time for me to walk my kids down to their specials, get back, get hooked up, clean everything up when I'm done. That does not leave any time for me to go to the bathroom, wash my parts, dry my parts, and get them put away. I don't know the science behind it, but putting the collection cups like where your milk actually touches things, putting them in the fridge makes it safe so that the milk doesn't go bad in them. So in between pumps, I put them in the fridge, and then I take them out of the fridge and hook them right back up. I don't do anything besides that. I wash my mom cozy collection cups once a day, just when I get home. So I'll use them at 5, 30, 10, 30, and 4. Then I'll put them in my little wash bin and wash them. Because my last pump of the day is always with my big medela pump in style. I am done pumping. So I am gonna take these off, put them in my bag, and then I will show you how I put the collection cups in the fridge. Now, these are empty. I'm just gonna put them straight in the fridge. I didn't wash them. I didn't wipe them down. They just go right in there.

I think I pumped around like 7:05. Watch the news. I pumped for 15 minutes. So I just got done pumping for 15 minutes this much. I'm gonna just dump and see how much I got. I don't really know from there, but. Good morning. Good morning. She has her four month checkup today. Pretty close here. Around like an hour and a half. So we gotta get ready for that. Lily, hold on. Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. I got these little membranes at my work. Yeah, I work at the hospital. So we have like a, a store where we have. She's definitely grabbing everything lately. So funny. But we definitely have all the like extra stuff for the spectra. So like anytime I need different parts, I can just go there. I'm not thinking about getting some like month and a half. I got nine ounces. Nine ounces, guys. So I going to be making two more bottles. I have five in the fridge. I have seven for the day. He has like seven, eight feedings through the day. We're just going those in the fridge with my other bottles. Then we're going to bake this, but without really because she want to touch everything away. Now she's a minute. All right, so I'm just going to level out 5 ounces. I need you a little funnel and a little scale like y'all be having. I want to know like the exact first I thought I was like, why would I want that? But I want one. So I'm gonna get one soon. You know, I like cheetah. I don't know if y'all noticed, but I love cheetah. So I seen a cheetah one on Amazon, so I want to get it. So pretty soon y'all see. Y'all will see me with my cheetah scale say that this one's kind of different because like it doesn't open so you can't really tell. But I know how much I put in here. It's so this is temperature sensing. So I know how much I put in there. It's 5 ounces and then there should be 4 ounces right here. I'm gonna dump in the bag like I said, you guys, I just been like doing this when I am home, when I can bake milk, you know, I keep up with my pumping like anxiety because at work it's kind of hard. Like I try to get around that hour but like if I'm busy because I've been like tuxed. I've been in charges, like discharges and admits paperwork and stuff like that. So it's been like I got to do that on a certain time. It's kind of harder. I try to get away, but they're pretty good with it. But I don't like to leave until I finish what I'm doing to go pump, you know. But yeah, okay. So I have nine ounces that I'm in the bag, put in the freezer. This is how much I have already in the freezer. Like I'm pretty happy with my friends. Like honestly, since I got these, these things have helped me so much. I don't know what it is. And also my like making my own lactation. Making my own lactation stuff and with my cookies and just like everything, you know, I've been able to like make this and still have milk for the baby. So I am actually grateful that I can do that. Cuz I didn't have coffee today because like I don't like to have that much caffeine. So I had one of those Lonnie things. So I was like, I'm going to have one of those. I'm not going to have coffee today, but I'm going to have coffee today and not have an Alani for the gym. So it was late for my evening pumpkin. Like not evening, afternoon pump after them. So I'm going to take my Akari baby pumping with me. Just gonna take one and you know, like just some pumping. I don't want to take two. I don't want extra stuff in my baby. So I'm gonna use my bayou Boo bag and take that. I'm such a Brad's girl fan till I die. I got a shirt and I get my daughter like the stuff. Like she has a brat doll and I seen they have the babies again so I had to put her to watch me. What I'm doing. I'll still freak out. All right, so in here I put. I'm. I have a Keurig, but I like iced coffee. So I put some. I brewed some coffee and then put it in there so it can be cold. I don't know what's gonna do. But it was this idea in my brain. So we're gonna use a little bit. I had to use the rest of this. Had a little bit left. I don't know. So I think that's just the donut shop, what I brewed and put in there. What are you doing? He loves watching me do anything with a scheduled program. I have this but I like to like kind of frost it a little more to put some in there. And I like to put it with my coffee cake flavored oat milk creamer a little bit. What are you doing? I got new glasses. I don't know if y'all can tell they were swim to them, but I love them and I love purple and they like purple too. Y'all can't see but I'll show you guys. Then I'm gonna put some of this berries and cream Instructions came around to my coffee and then I want a little more. So cute. Y'all.

Nope. Let's start again. Place your pump or ladybug in the fridge and let it cool down for 30 minutes to an hour. Once your freshly pumped milk reaches the same temperature as the storage bag, you can mix your milk. You can add the milk on the tag, but do not change the time. The whole container is as old as the first milk.","Reply to @chill_candy  How to safely store and mix breast milk!

So in the mornings I pump. Well, actually I pump in the middle of the night or very early morning. And then my daughter either wakes up and I nurse her or if she doesn't wake up, I pump as I'm getting ready for work. So my pump or feed before I leave is around 7am and I get to work at a pump at 10am, which is now. And then I pump at 1pm and at 3pm before I go back home. This morning's pump looks like I have like 6 ounces which is pretty good for the 10am I've been averaging, like trying to do two things at once, like an extra 10 to 15 ounces a day that goes in the freezer. So I'm able to feed my daughter and pump an extra 10 ounces or more a day when I'm at home. And then when I'm at work I pump like 20 plus ounces each day. So that's awesome. It's going good so far, so hopefully I can keep it up. Actually just bought a freezer, an extra deep freezer for just her milk. So that's kind of exciting. And it's already half full and she is three months old so I'm just bagging her milk now and then I'll take it home at the end of the day and put it in the freezer. That is it. Also, I've been asked how much I bag per each thing. Sometimes I do 4 ounces. She's been drinking 3 to 4 ounces usually. But I also do some in smaller increments just because as she gets older and I need to add more in. So say she's drinking 5 ounces. I can do a 3 and a 2. So I just do various from like 2 to 4 ounces is what I bag.","My daily work life of pumping 101. #pumping #pumping101 #pumpingatwork #breastfeeding #baggingmilkagain #newmama #3monthsold #figuringitoutaswego #freezerstash So I've had people ask me what pumping's like, being back to work and my schedule for pumping.

Today our WI fi went down, so I had to find a creative way to get my work done. I put in my pump and then I worked for a while until they shut off. I can't remember how long it takes these to shut off, but I think it's like 20ish minutes. And I brought a bottle to put the milk in and this is when I realized there's like none in here. My baby is almost 14 months old, so he might not be drinking as much. I have no idea. I haven't pumped in forever. I did nurse him before I had left, so he might have emptied me, I'm not sure. Kind of have given up on keeping track. Then I put the lid on it and this moment was when I realized that I forgot to put my insert in to give myself the correct flange size. And that's probably why I didn't empty very well. So this is me realizing that. And then I decided to put it back in and try pumping again. I didn't get a lot that second time either, so I don't know what is going on. I ended up just leaving the breast milk bottle in my bag. Breast milk is good at room temperature for like four to six hours. And I knew I was going to be home before then, so I wasn't too worried about it. At this point, I'm not really nursing to like replace a bottle that my baby would be drinking. It is more so for my comfort. And then I pumped a few hours later. I think it was like two and a half, maybe three, for like a just a short time period. I do plan on nursing until my baby is 2, so I think I'm gonna add some more pumping sessions in. He's just kind of in a stage where he does like very short, frequent nursing sessions. So I'm not sure pumping for long periods of time is like mimicking his feeding habits at the moment. Anyway, I ended my time with about 3 ounces. I'll probably give this to him in a cup later or make him some pancakes or something with it. I used to get really intimidated pumping in public, but I've gotten more comfortable with it in the last few months. So if you are also really anxious, I just encourage you to do it because the more you do it, the more other moms feel comfortable doing it as well.","I haven‚Äôt filmed one of these in a minute! #pumpwithme #pumpingmom #nursingmom #pumpingatwork #pumpinpublic  Pump with me while I work remotely at a coffee shop.

Understanding guidelines for pumping and collecting breast milk stressed me out so much before I had a baby. So let's go through what those are and how. I currently collect and store all of my breast milk. For the first six weeks of my baby's life, I did not pump. I only collected breast milk using my haka on the other side whenever I would feed him. At about six weeks we introduced one bottle a day and I started pumping during that session. So I collected even more breast milk. And now most of the time when we leave the house or sometimes in the evenings when my husband gets home from work, we feed a bottle and I pump. And once pumping more, I started using the pitcher method to collect and store the breast milk. I use the Dr. Brown's formula pitcher and this thing is amazing because it has a pump on it so that you can basically mix up the milk. And this is nice because some sources say you're not supposed to shake breast milk. Others say it's fine, but I prefer to just use this pump to stir it all up. Also, sorry if you can hear my baby grunting in the background, but this pump on this picture is awesome because as breast milk sits, the fat separates out and so this easily mixes it all back together. I like using the pitcher method because it's really efficient to be able bag a bunch of breast milk at once. Then it's nice to not have several different bottles of breast milk in the fridge. And I also like it because it combines all of your breast milk together. Your milk can have different consistencies and qualities depending on what time of day you pump, if it's 4 milk or hind milk and other factors based on what your baby needs at the time. So I like combining it all and mixing it up. That way all of the different nutrients and elements of breast milk pumped at different times can just combine together. That way it doesn't matter what time of day my baby eats this milk once it's stored. The general guidelines for breast milk is that freshly pumped or expressed milk can remain at room temperature for up to four hours and then once you put it into the fridge, it can remain in the fridge for four days. Once you freeze it, you can keep it in the freezer for three to six months or if you have a deep freezer, six to 12 months. We actually have two deep freezers in our garage because our dog's food is frozen and we stock up on it whenever it goes on sale. So now we also use those Deep freezers to store breast milk. So I basically bag breast milk every four days. I start the four days from the first time I put any milk into the pitcher. So if I put the first milk in the picture on Saturday, I will continue collecting milk through Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then bag the milk on Tuesday. That way the oldest milk in the picture is no older than four days. When it's time to bag the milk, I mix it all up and I get a bunch of bags ready. My favorite bags to use are the up and up brand from Target. I've tried out a bunch of different breast milk bags and these ones are my favorite because I haven't had any spills with them. They're easy to pour out when you thaw the milk and pour it into a bottle and they seem to close up really well so nothing spills out. I've experimented so much with how much breast milk I store bags. At first I was doing fewer bags with higher quantities, but I found that because we don't feed my baby consistently with a bottle, it varies depending on how hungry he is, so it's easier to store it in smaller quantities. So I typically do 2 and 3 ounce bags. To be efficient, I like to label a bunch at once and then pour a bunch. Sometimes I'll look at how many ounces are in the pitcher and calculate it out, but sometimes I'll just kind of label a bunch of bags, pour and then see how much is left. Something really important is do not measure on the breast milk bags. Measurements on those bags are never accurate. So I pour from the pitcher into a bottle, can measure out the proper quantities, and then I pour the milk into the bag to close it. I zip up half of the bag and then put it on the edge of the counter to get all of the air bubbles out. And then I zip up the rest of the bag and lay it flat. Once I've bagged up all of my milk, I lay it all flat in the freezer to freeze. Also, when storing milk in the fridge before you freeze it, you do not want to add freshly expressed milk to already chilled milk in the fridge. So what I do is after I use the haaka or pump, I put the haka or my pump parts directly in the fridge to let the milk chill. And then once it's chilled and I need to use the haaka or the pump the next time, I then pour it into pitcher. But you want to keep it in the fridge between uses so that the milk residue left over in it doesn't spread. If I need to use the haaka or pump again before the milk is chilled. I'll just pour it into a separate bottle before pouring it into the whole pitcher of chilled milk. Some sources say you don't need to do this and you can pour freshly expressed milk directly into chilled milk, but I do it still just to be safe, because some sources do say you don't want to do that.

Understanding guidelines for pumping and collecting breast milk stressed me out so much before I had a baby. So let's go through what those are and how. I currently collect and store all of my breast milk. For the first six weeks of my baby's life, I did not pump. I only collected breast milk using my haka on the other side whenever I would feed him. At about six weeks we introduced one bottle a day and I started pumping during that session. So I collected even more breast milk. And now most of the time when we leave the house or sometimes in the evenings when my husband gets home from work, we feed a bottle and I pump. And once pumping more, I started using the pitcher method to collect and store the breast milk. I use the Dr. Brown's formula pitcher and this thing is amazing because it has a pump on it so that you can basically mix up the milk. And this is nice because some sources say you're not supposed to shake breast milk. Others say it's fine, but I prefer to just use this pump to stir it all up. Also, sorry if you can hear my baby grunting in the background, but this pump on this picture is awesome because as breast milk sits, the fat separates out and so this easily mixes it all back together. I like using the pitcher method because it's really efficient to be able bag a bunch of breast milk at once. Then it's nice to not have several different bottles of breast milk in the fridge. And I also like it because it combines all of your breast milk together. Your milk can have different consistencies and qualities depending on what time of day you pump, if it's 4 milk or hind milk and other factors based on what your baby needs at the time. So I like combining it all and mixing it up. That way all of the different nutrients and elements of breast milk pumped at different times can just combine together. That way it doesn't matter what time of day my baby eats this milk once it's stored. The general guidelines for breast milk is that freshly pumped or expressed milk can remain at room temperature for up to four hours and then once you put it into the fridge, it can remain in the fridge for four days. Once you freeze it, you can keep it in the freezer for three to six months or if you have a deep freezer, six to 12 months. We actually have two deep freezers in our garage because our dog's food is frozen and we stock up on it whenever it goes on sale. So now we also use those Deep freezers to store breast milk. So I basically bag breast milk every four days. I start the four days from the first time I put any milk into the pitcher. So if I put the first milk in the picture on Saturday, I will continue collecting milk through Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then bag the milk on Tuesday. That way the oldest milk in the picture is no older than four days. When it's time to bag the milk, I mix it all up and I get a bunch of bags ready. My favorite bags to use are the up and up brand from Target. I've tried out a bunch of different breast milk bags and these ones are my favorite because I haven't had any spills with them. They're easy to pour out when you thaw the milk and pour it into a bottle and they seem to close up really well so nothing spills out. I've experimented so much with how much breast milk I store bags. At first I was doing fewer bags with higher quantities, but I found that because we don't feed my baby consistently with a bottle, it varies depending on how hungry he is, so it's easier to store it in smaller quantities. So I typically do 2 and 3 ounce bags. To be efficient, I like to label a bunch at once and then pour a bunch. Sometimes I'll look at how many ounces are in the pitcher and calculate it out, but sometimes I'll just kind of label a bunch of bags, pour and then see how much is left. Something really important is do not measure on the breast milk bags. Measurements on those bags are never accurate. So I pour from the pitcher into a bottle, can measure out the proper quantities, and then I pour the milk into the bag to close it. I zip up half of the bag and then put it on the edge of the counter to get all of the air bubbles out. And then I zip up the rest of the bag and lay it flat. Once I've bagged up all of my milk, I lay it all flat in the freezer to freeze. Also, when storing milk in the fridge before you freeze it, you do not want to add freshly expressed milk to already chilled milk in the fridge. So what I do is after I use the haaka or pump, I put the haka or my pump parts directly in the fridge to let the milk chill. And then once it's chilled and I need to use the haaka or the pump the next time, I then pour it into pitcher. But you want to keep it in the fridge between uses so that the milk residue left over in it doesn't spread. If I need to use the haaka or pump again before the milk is chilled. I'll just pour it into a separate bottle before pouring it into the whole pitcher of chilled milk. Some sources say you don't need to do this and you can pour freshly expressed milk directly into chilled milk, but I do it still just to be safe, because some sources do say you don't want to do that. Also, I keep the haaka and pump parts in the fridge after each use and only wash and sanitize them every 24 hours. That's how I collect and store my breast milk. I hope that this was helpful and let me know if you guys have any questions."

But even this, to hydrate and boost your milk Supply is a 10 out of 10. I highly recommend body armor water bottles and storage bottles to store your milk, to clean your pumps. I would actually before, because I was working a little bit more than four hours, so I was working close to six, seven, like, as I. When I first started, after I came back, you know, from having the baby and Mandela wipes and actually, like, cleaning them somewhere sometimes even at a gas station. Like, you know, I.

My name is Trish. I'm a full time labor and delivery nurse and my first pump is usually before I leave for my shift. I make sure I go to work with clean and sanitized pump parts and I keep them in a Ziploc bag. I try to pump at least three times during a 12 hour shift, which is every four hours and which matches how often my baby feeds at home. This is me pumping and eating breakfast at the same time. I am nearing my period here, which dips my supply, but it usually picks right back up. I've pumped about 4 ounces during this pump session. After each session I wash my pump parts and do the fridge hack, which is basically storing them in the fridge. And here's me pumping for the second time during my shift. I didn't get to show it, but I pumped about 3 and 12 ounces. And here's my third pump session of my 12 hour shift. I pumped about 4 ounces this time. So my whole 12 hour shift I pumped a total of 11 and 12 ounces, which honestly isn't that bad considering that I'm getting my period soon and my supply usually dips. I hope you guys enjoy this video.

I get asked on what the picture method is, how it works, and I figured I would make a video on it when I had the time. Now being the time. So here I have a fresh new pitcher. I started it today, which is March 4, 2024. So the way that this works is yesterday, the day before, I prepped all of my daughter's bottles. So she normally drinks a total of 28 ounces a day. So I like to prep 10 bottles for her just in case she needs extra on the third night. And then I freeze all the milk on the third night that I have left over after prepping those bottles. And that's what I feed her on the day that I'm filling up a new pitcher. So you can say I am one day ahead. Now, this pitcher, it depends on your comfort level. You can either have a full pitcher right here, and if I want, I can prep her bottles tonight. And whatever I have left over, I can freeze. Or if you're really busy, mom, milk is good in the fridge up to four days. So you can have four days where you can combine and pull milk together, essentially. And on the third day, that's when you can go ahead, prep bottles and freeze the rest. That is what I do. You know, it depends on your comfort level. It's perfectly safe. It's good to go. You know, it's. It, it's okay to do that. Some people don't like to do that. Some people do it each night. It's just on your personal comfort level. For example, today, March 4th, on March 7th, it's when I'm gonna go ahead and make her bottles and whatever I have left over, I'm gonna freeze. And some people do it different. In this case, I'm an exclusive pumper. But some people nurse and do the pitcher method, go ahead and nurse their baby and pump. And over the course of four days, they'll throw it inside a little pitcher or a day. They don't have to prep any bottles or anything because they're nursing. So they'll just freeze it and have it right there just in case. This all depends on your situation, your comfort level, how you like it, how you prefer to do it. Everything, everything is safe as long as you're following guidelines. Whether milk has to be the same temperature once you combine it to prevent bacteria growth, sure. And there's a lot of mixed opinions on it. Personally, just to be safe, put it in the fridge, then I combine it. Secondly, clean hands, wash your hands, everything. Same protocol, wash all the parts, you know, everything sterilized and all. You know, as long as you're following those guidelines. Some people like to separate AM and PM PM milk. I've gotten a bunch of comments about this. If you like to do that, good for you. Personally, if I separate or if I don't separate, I don't see a difference. My daughter sleeps the same. I. I don't have any complaints about that. So I just do what works best for me. You. That is essentially what the picture method is. It's worked out for me. I've been doing it for about five months, I want to say, and it's a. It's a great system to do, honestly.

Ish. #pitchermethod #breastmilk #breastfeeding #pumping #pumpingmom #newmom #newmomtips #experiment #pmmilk #babysleep #breastmilktok #milkstorage #milkstoragetips #bottlefeeding ,"It's a great question. I don't blame you for wanting an update. Over half a million of you guys have watched that video. I just want to emphasize that this is just a funny little experiment. I don't necessarily think that there is such thing as a magic potion to give you the true night by night update. She slept through the night two nights in a row and since then she's had wake ups some she puts herself back to sleep on and I've only ever actually gone to feed her once a night for the other two nights since I posted that video. Been around maybe 4am I do think she's kind of in the midst of her sleep regression as she is figuring this out and I can tell when she's feeding. If she wakes up at 4, she's not hungry, she's just kind of awake and wanting something to do, some comfort. I don't know if I buy that the reason she slept through the night that night was because of PM milk or what. But like I said in my video, you might as well just keep it going if you find something that worked. So I guess we have a PM pitcher and an AM pitcher now. This is my pump from last night. Dumping it into our PM pitcher. I know this is not the intended use of this. This is supposed to be a butt spreader, but I use it as a milk fat scraper in order to get all that good stuff that's sticks to the side that's like yogurt and like that's what makes your baby full. I had reached the 4th day on my AM picture this morning so I froze everything and I'm starting a new picture. When I start a new picture I put the date on the bag so that I don't forget when I started. Normally I pump with my hands free pump in the morning, but we're not about waking up early in the morning and cleaning pump parts. Speaking of cleaning pump parts, I feel like I just discovered what many people probably already know but the biggest life hack ever, which is that this Dapple brand bottle cleaning soap also makes dishwasher pods. Since I have made this discovery, I have washed almost no bottles or pump parts by hand because why make things harder for yourself when you sit? So many of you guys have questions about baby sleep. I am not an expert on this or baby sleep, but I was really proud of her the night that she slept through the night. When she Woke up at 4 I didn't feel mad or sad about it. She's on this little journey of figuring out her sleep patterns and how she can get herself back to sleep and how she sleeps best. I try not to put too much pressure on her or us. On the nights that it works, we sleep and we celebrate. And on the nights that it doesn't, we just try again the next night.","Replying to @Lauren Samsel has it been consistent? Ish. #pitchermethod #breastmilk #breastfeeding #pumping #pumpingmom #newmom #newmomtips #experiment #pmmilk #babysleep #breastmilktok #milkstorage #milkstoragetips #bottlefeeding  It's a great question. I don't blame you for wanting an update. Over half a million of you guys have watched that video. I just want to emphasize that this is just a funny little experiment. I don't necessarily think that there is such thing as a magic potion to give you the true night by night update. She slept through the night two nights in a row and since then she's had wake ups some she puts herself back to sleep on and I've only ever actually gone to feed her once a night for the other two nights since I posted that video. Been around maybe 4am I do think she's kind of in the midst of her sleep regression as she is figuring this out and I can tell when she's feeding. If she wakes up at 4, she's not hungry, she's just kind of awake and wanting something to do, some comfort. I don't know if I buy that the reason she slept through the night that night was because of PM milk or what. But like I said in my video, you might as well just keep it going if you find something that worked. So I guess we have a PM pitcher and an AM pitcher now. This is my pump from last night.

So just save it for later. Freshly pumped milk can stay room temp for four hours. It can go into the refrigerator in like a collection for four days and you can at home I have like a big mason jar and I'll just add each pumping session to it and then later on I'll divvy it up between the bags. And then if you have a deep freezer, you can freeze it for a year. Typically I would do 20 minutes, but I'm excited to see my grunge it. I like to store everything in a wet bag. I also bring a manual pump with me just in case something happens or like it dies and I can't use it because I don't want any car ducks. So my little freezer bag with my ice packs, I'm gonna put this mug in there and then also just put my puppy parts in there. I could put it in a bag, I just don't feel like doing it. Extra pump parts on top. Always check your flanges. That has a little slit in it that's a little bit further. So that means it's time to replace it because the suction isn't going to be as good. But I brought it just in case. One thing to keep in mind when traveling is if you are going like last weekend I traveled and I went to a friend's house so I froze it and then I had to travel back home with it and I had little ice packs. But if you have it frozen and it partially defrosts, as long as there's some crystals in there, you're okay to refreeze it. Since this will not be frozen when I put it in there, once we get to the Airbnb, then I'll freeze it. But it'll be fine. I still have my ice packs but. But it would be okay at room temp for four hours.

No refrigerator, just a cooler bag situation. I was looking at my hair line because I'm having very bad postpartum hair loss. And it just started like two months ago. I would say two months postpartum. My hair and my body, I guess, was still thinking it was pregnant. And I was having great, great hair, but now it's just falling out everywhere all the time. I got Nutrafol, the supplement to help you grow hair, and also the serum Vegamore, I think it's called to put in my hair. So I'm just doing the most over here this day. I was feeling a little discouraged on the amount of milk that I was pumping. Because pumpkin, prior to going back to work, I only really pumped after I fed her or say if she got a bottle from my freezer stash that I built up early on, which wasn't a lot. I mean, it was just like I had maybe 20 bags in my freezer stash. So I'm looking into getting the Spectra pump because what I see is that there's less parts to clean. And this LV pump has so many parts when you have to take it out and clean it. That's why I only use one side at a time and just pull po and just pump both breasts using one pump, which takes so much more time. I don't know. I'm still just trying to get this whole thing down. Like my. My whole situation, My whole pumping at work situation we can call it. See, obviously I just spilt a shit ton of milk because I have to clean all these parts and I didn't know that there was just milk all situated at the bottom of this pump. So if you guys could let me know your favorite breast pumps on the go and any milk boosting tips and tricks, I would greatly appreciate it.","When they say don‚Äôt cry over spilt milk they obviously only meant cows milk. #pumpingmom #pumpingatwork #pumpingtips #milksupply #pumpingonthego  This is day two of pumping in the back of my truck at work on the go.

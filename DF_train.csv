If you're a first time mom or new mom, you might be wondering if you can boil your bottles or use a sterilizer or just flat out use the dishwasher. And the answer is yes, you can use the dishwasher. But let me tell you why I do not. If you do want to use your dishwasher, you just want to make sure it has the sanitize option right here. And also you want to get one of these containers that you can put all the little miniature pieces in. That way they don't fall out. Another option that you can do if you don't want to boil your bottles because sometimes if you leave them too long in there, it can ruin them. You get a regular sterilizer like this. Now, the reason that I stopped using my dishwasher after about two or three weeks, we started using the dishwasher and it was a lifesaver and time saving. But let me show you why we don't use it anymore. And yes, we do use the munchkin container for our stuff. And one of the green pieces from our Dr. Brown bottles fell out and melted on the ring where it gets hot to sanitize it and ruined all of our bottles that were in the dishwasher because it got this horrible, horrible plastic smell on all of them. And I was like, this has to be not safe for him. And just out of caution, I asked my fiance to stop on his way home from work and get all new bottles because I was too worried about it. And also we had a wine glass break the same time that the green thing melt, we had a wine glass break and glass went all over the dishwasher too. So you can use a dishwasher, it's just up to you.

I'm three months postpartum and I have filled our chest freezer full of breast milk, so it's time to pack some up and get it ready for a donation. So here's what we're working with. Normally, when I do a breast milk donation, I will take all my breast milk out of the freezer and start sorting it by oldest to newest. I want to make sure that I'm rotating through my milk stash so that the oldest milk is on the top and easiest to grab and the newest milk is on the bottom. Another thing that I do to help keep my freezer stash organized is by freezing each bag in four ounce increments. And then when I make my milk bricks, I use 10 bags, so each milk brick is 40 ounces. Storing my milk in 40 ounce milk bricks allows me to be able to count how many milk bricks I have and multiply that by 40 and then I can quickly figure out how many ounces I have frozen. Once I'm done sorting through, counting, and organizing all my milk, I will put all the milk that I am going to keep for myself back in the freezer and then I will use a laundry basket to pack up the milk that I'm going to be donating.

It is 7 o'clock in the morning. I have been up since 5am that's my new daily routine since having a baby before I had him. Like, I work from home and I start work at 8. So I would just be getting up right now at 7, but I've been up for two hours already. So I got up, I pumped at 5, and then I fed. Lordy. Around like 5, 45, 6. And I was just about to get in the shower, but I remembered I had started the dishwasher. So now I have to wait like another 45 minutes or so for the dishwasher to finish up before I can get in the shower. Because it's like a hot water situation. Like the dishwasher takes up all the hot water. I don't know if anyone else's house is like that, but that's how my house is. So I figured while I have all this extra time waiting for the dishwasher to get done, I might as well do the first day of my mama strong, like workouts. I'm actually not in the workout section yet. I'm in the hazy days postpartum incubator. So it's like not like working out. It's more like a body check in, so to speak. Like getting in touch with your core and just kind of doing some stabilizing work. So I did that this morning. These postpartum ones are pretty short. They're not like workout. I really wouldn't call it a workout. It was only eight minutes long, so I mean, that was easy to knock out. And now I'm just doing his bottles. Usually I don't get on tick tock before I shower and blow dry my hair. It just makes me uncomfortable. But I don't know, maybe I'm just gonna show you guys a more honest, realistic, every point of view version of my life right now, which includes me being unshowered, with dirty hair and no mascara. I guess I'm pouring nine bottles today instead of eight because he's like going through a growth spurt. I feel like he's always going through a growth spurt, but right now he's like eating every hour and a half to two hours instead of every three hours. He's been doing that for like two days. So I'm just trying to make extra bottles so we don't have to scramble later in the day. And you know what? I think I'm gonna thaw some frozen milk today so that I'm not, you know, so I'm using the oldest milk first and not just stockpiling, like, getting a little bit of a rotation going. Okay. So after bottling all the breast milk, I have this much left. It's a little bit over a half a cup, probably like 5 ounces, approximately. So I'm gonna go ahead and bag this. And here's all yesterday's milk.","#makebottleswithme #firsttimemom #postpartum #exclusivepumping #pumpingmom  Good morning. It is 7 o'clock in the morning.

I'm in the hazy days postpartum incubator. So it's like not like working out. It's more like a body check in, so to speak. Like getting in touch with your core and just kind of doing some stabilizing work. So I did that this morning. These postpartum ones are pretty short. They're not like workout. I really wouldn't call it a workout. It was only eight minutes long, so I mean, that was easy to knock out. And now I'm just doing his bottles. Usually I don't get on tick tock before I shower and blow dry my hair. It just makes me uncomfortable. But I don't know, maybe I'm just gonna show you guys a more honest, realistic, every point of view version of my life right now, which includes me being unshowered, with dirty hair and no mascara. I guess I'm pouring nine bottles today instead of eight because he's like going through a growth spurt. I feel like he's always going through a growth spurt, but right now he's like eating every hour and a half to two hours instead of every three hours. He's been doing that for like two days. So I'm just trying to make extra bottles so we don't have to scramble later in the day. And you know what? I think I'm gonna thaw some frozen milk today so that I'm not, you know, so I'm using the oldest milk first and not just stockpiling, like, getting a little bit of a rotation going. Okay. So after bottling all the breast milk, I have this much left. It's a little bit over a half a cup, probably like 5 ounces, approximately. So I'm gonna go ahead and bag this. And here's all yesterday's milk."

He needs to sleep. He needs to sleep so bad. We've gone through all of our battles today. We are nearing the end of leap four. The next, I think. I think it ends on the 18th. Today is the 7th, so about 10 more days. And it just was freaking long leap. No one told me that it would be this rough for this long. So, yes, he is kind of whining in the background. I have him down for a nap in our bedroom, but he's kind of a loud whiner these days. And I don't even have any milk to give him. Like, I don't usually like to give him milk when he's trying to go to sleep, but I feel like with this leap, sometimes that's the only thing that works. I guess it's, like, comforting to him. I don't know. But we're definitely on a struggle bus. So I was like, I don't even have any other bottles to give you, so I need to go make bottles and you need to sleep. So I might make. We'll see what I have in just a second. But I might make a small bottle, like 2 or 3 ounces after I'm done with this to. To give him right now. But I still am not any better at pouring the right amount. He's about to lose it. I'm still not any better about pouring the right amount the first time, but, you know, whatever. So I haven't talked really on here lately. Been super busy with work. Oh, my gosh. He's, like, losing it sometimes. That's what he needs to do before I leave, before I go in there. I'm not like a full cry it out kind of person, but I'm not a. Oh, he's crying. I need to run to his side. He's been doing this thing where, like, when he loses it, he loses it. Sure, you can hear him. But anyways, my kid is 19 weeks old today, and we are still in survival mode. Not the thriving mode. I hope to be thriving one day, but for now, surviving. I'll take it. Okay, let me go make. Let me go make him a bottle. I'll be right back. Okay. I made him a bottle. It's warming up right now. So, yes, 19 weeks old today, the day that I'm recording this, he's really close to rolling over. So that's like, his milestones, like, from his. From his back to his belly. He's really close to rolling over. I'm not looking forward to not using this waddle because that's going to be a rough transition. He does typically, except for today, really well with his fl. So he's really good at grasping things, picking things up, things like that. So really exciting to, like, see him, you know, have, like, new. New things happening. He's so unhappy right now, but I'm working on a bottle and he is safe. And sometimes you just gotta, like, find the patience to just wait until the bottle is done and then you can hope that the bottle will be helpful. Right. So anyways, holiday season, we hosted some family last weekend for nearly Christmas. I'm glad that's over. We have all of my decorations up, and so that's nice because now I can just, like, enjoy them. So. All right, well, that's that.

Additionally, I am like a hobby baker. I used to kind of have a cookie business but I decided to not continue with it. Just time and like I'm always worried about like the legalities of like owning your own business. So anyways, basically I've been up pretty late the past few nights baking cookies and stuff because I had so many people ask for for Christmas cookies this year. And our dishwasher decided to just, you know, go out on us. Typical holiday, you know, time. And so I'm like, okay, well if I do cookies then I can pay for our new dishwasher. So just been a late couple nights, so I'm already tired because of that. And then just over the last two weeks my son sleep has not been good. I'm very grateful for my partner. He sleeps with the bassinet on his side of the bed. I think it just, it worked much better for us because he wasn't waking up at all and I would have to pump and then like if they left him sleeping in there and tried to feed my kid, it just like was really complicated. Like props to single moms, yo. Like it's just tough stuff, I don't know how you do it. But anyways, and so that's like just worked for us best over time. Especially since like how much time I put in, you know, prepping bottles, pumping, bagging milk. You know, it's kind of like how me and my partner make things like quote unquote fair. But what's not fair is like the lack of sleep he gets. Like I technically probably get more or better sleep than he does. So I feel bad about that, but it's like I don't know what else to do. So anyways, he deals more with like my son kind of stirring in the middle of the night and trying to kind of get him back to sleep. But the last two weeks have been like he's serious sleep regression. Of course we're in the four month, that's like pretty common. But it's been bad, bad, bad the last, I would say two nights, like so bad. And so I didn't prep bottles last night cuz I was tired. So we had like two left in the fridge and I'm like okay, I hope that that's enough. So I've already made like a couple bottles today. I think two more bottles today that I just like poured from the pitcher. I'm still going to prep nine bottles and that way tonight I won't have to do as many If I do it, you can do it tonight. Otherwise, this, like, buys me time till tomorrow. So I'm still going to prep nine bottles, and I just. I don't know if I'm going to buy milk right now or. The issue is I don't have a lot of, like, fridge space either, so I kind of need to bag milk. But also, like, I think my son is. Hold on. I think my son is about to lose it. He's been so great, honestly. He's been sitting in, like, his little jumper thing for a little while now, and I've been able to get some work done. I've been able to clean up. Hold on again. So I'm very grateful, but I just know, like, that time is limited. You know, like, that only lasts for so long, so I'm like. And I don't know, I just have mixed feelings on the subject. I still have more cookies to make tonight, so hopefully just me kind of getting caught up. I work from home on Thursdays, and so I use kind of like what I would use as my breaks, too, to switch the laundry out. And, like, right now I'm prepping bottles, which will take me, like, five minutes max. So I just try to keep things moving. And of course, I'm on my son's timeline all the time, so I feel like this isn't the right. It's not. I'm not even using the right thing for my. That's great. Anyways, I'm going to go.

Like sometimes he doesn't drink the very end of it, but he never seems to be like hung more hungry after he's done with the five. Like very rarely do we ever have to make more right now. So I don't know what's going on but. But all I know is I'm ready for some freaking sleep. So ready for sleep. Like ugh. So I don't know, I don't know what's going on. If you've experienced it before, let me know. Have any suggestions, I'm all ears. But mostly just send the sleep guides our way because losing it. I'm even gonna make 10 bottles just. Just in case. So yes, that's what I have going on. So I think I mentioned it in a previous video. I'm like so behind on posting videos. I think I just am posting like I'm not even done with November yet and we are in the 20s of December. I mean Christmas is just a few days away, but I'm like a hobby baker, like sugar cookie baker. I was gonna have like a business at some point, but it just like the legalities and cottage food laws and that was just too much for me to like be worrying about. So I just have decided to truly just be a hobby baker and do it for fun and whatnot. But our dishwasher went out So I decided to sell my Christmas cookies just like to friends and family. And I wound up getting. I think I've gotten 42, 43 orders. So by the time it's all said and done, I will have. I will have had. I think I calculated it to be. I don't remember, but it was like over 500 cookies that I will have had to bake wild. I'm pretty much done now. I really. I'm done baking at least I really only have to do. I have a friend who really wants gluten free, so I'm gonna do that for her. So that's the only one. I don't make those tomorrow. She's picking up on Friday, so I have to make frosting tonight. And I teach a fitness class tonight, so. And I don't know when I'm gonna do Christmas shopping. So I need a lot of help. Obviously I need sleep and I can't wait because next week I work for university and the entire campus is closed. And so I get to like actually relax. I won't be doing cookies. I can't freaking wait. Hopefully I can talk myself into napping while my son naps. I kind of have a problem with that. Like, I don't know when it's just us and it's like, I don't know why. Middle of the day, just a real struggle for me. So hopefully I can talk myself into sleeping when he sleeps. I hope I can get all my Christmas shopping done. My husband's gonna drop our son off with me at the fitness studio I work at. When I'm done and he's gonna go on. We have like this like go karting place. His friend gets in for basically free for some reason. So he's gonna go do that. And I might take our son over to Target and just do a quick little inventory run of what options we have for Christmas presents. And also Target's open till like midnight, so they need to. I can go back later. So I'm not gonna bag milk just yet. I still technically have at least two more pumps. I've only pumped twice today, so I need to pump again. I probably will only pump four times today, and that's okay. So I have at least one more pump to combine with this. I have three full bottles, like big bottles in the fridge. So I probably have about 30 ounces in the fridge to add to this. And then I will add whatever I can. Anyways pray for me that I get sleep."," Okay, so it's not even 4 o'clock and normally I do my bottles late at night and we're completely out of bottles. I did it like a little early yesterday, but I did one extra. So I did 10. And I don't know, we're still in this four month sleep regression and it. It's so rough. So rough. I can't wait. It's over. So. So anyways, my husband just left to run a few errands and he took our son with him. He's like. But we're out of bottles. Like I guess I'll be prepping some more earlier. So I honestly probably will do a second bottle prep today, you know, at the usual hour as I'm prepping to wind down for the night and just make sure I'm back up to the nine and hopefully we'll get back on track. So I don't know if he's just like growing a lot. I mean he's literally chugging the bottle when we give it to him. So he's hungry. But I'm just.

If your baby is primarily feeding from your body and you are simply pumping so that you have some milk in the event that you need to go out or for an emergency, what I usually suggest is sterilizing an ice cube tray and then once you've pumped cool the milk in the fridge, shake it up, pour, pour it into the ice cube tray, slide that into a Ziploc bag so that it stays airtight and freeze it in little 1oz cubes. Makes it easier to thaw and heat when you need to give it to baby. It also makes it easier to just thaw and heat the quantity that you're going to need.

If you have a preemie, talk to your doctor about when you can stop doing the extra cleaning. If you're exclusively pumping or pumping at work, you can leave your pump parts in the fridge between pumping sessions because all that's on them are breast milk, which can stay good in the fridge for five to eight days. Clean them once a day at the end of the day, but you don't have to clean them after every pump. You can put them in a wet to dry bag or a Ziploc bag in the fridge. You also don't have to sanitize them the microwave or boil them in boiling water every day or at all. If you're washing them well with warm soapy water and drying them either by air or by hand, they should be clean enough for the baby. Don't leave your pump parts soaking in the sink.

I also don't think that I would still be pumping if I was connected to a wall because it is just so much work. It's overwhelmin.

I know a lot of people say that you're not supposed to do that because the suction is not as strong and so you can have supply issues with it. For me, the hospital pump was way too strong and was painful, and I've never had a problem keeping up my supply using a portable. I also don't think that I would still be pumping if I was connected to a wall because it is just so much work. It's overwhelmin.

So I'm a nurse and it's totally not relevant to your question, but I haven't found any, like, nursing scrubs that are good for freaking breast pumping and stuff. It's a struggle. But this one has like a little zipper, so it's like a little lower. It makes it where I'm able to actually like bring things in and out. Key. So how often I'm pumping during the day, I pump, I try to pump because we are not perfect, but I try to pump every three hours. Now, realistically, I might be hitting the four hour mark a lot of the times. All my, like, slower days where I'm not as busy. I'm definitely hitting the three hour mark. In the beginning though, when my baby was first born, up until he was like maybe two months old, I pumped every two hours. Now it was definitely tricky because I actually breastfed him for the first month and a half. And then after I would breastfeed him, I would pump right after giving him an ounce of pumped milk. I would then put the pumps on. So it was probably like 20 minutes after he finished eating. I would then pump. So then my body was like, I guess triggering, like, all right, well, she needs more milk. She needs more milk. And I think that's one of the biggest reasons for my production of milk. But. And I normally just pump like for 15 minutes. Before, I used to pump for like 12 minutes, honestly, because I felt like after the 12 minute mark, like, I wasn't really getting any milk. And like, three minutes is a lot for a new mom. So a lot of the times I found myself like stopping, like, I was like, sometimes I was like, oh, 10 minutes, I got 5 ounces. Cool, I'm done. Like. But then two, I started to realize it only takes the baby a certain amount of time to eat off my breast and to be full. If you haven't gone to a lactationist person, a lactation person, then I would if I was you. It was pretty cool because they were able to weigh the baby right before feed and right after he like latched on and fed for me and he ate three and a half ounces off my boob. Now this was like over a month ago, but it was cool to know that he's actually drinking and getting what he needs. And then. Yeah, but back to the, for the how long portion, I mean, it really, it really, I don't know, I'd say at least 15 minutes. At least 15 minutes. There's some times where I feel like, alright, it's not really that great. I'll leave it on for 20 minutes. Especially if I've realized like maybe the suction was wrong or and I didn't notice and I kept moving around and then I'm like, wait, there's no way. Like I just only got 2 ounces out and I still feel like there's milk in my boobs. So then I'll like keep it back on again and I'll just like massage while I do another few minutes. Always listen to your body. That's what I'll say. Because you just never know the flange size. That thing is crazy. Like I have a size here, I'm a size 17 and a 16 on the other side. But I was using like a 19 and a 21 and I was still getting milk. Like I really was. But I don't think I was getting, I don't know, as much milk and my nipples definitely hurt it more. So the right flange size is amazing. And again the lactation specialist was able to size me and answer the questions I had as far as like how deep really is unibody supposed to go and all that good stuff. And this is why it's so hard for me to make videos because I feel like I sidetrack everywhere in this conversation. Like you literally only asked how many times I pump and for how long. But yeah, so going back to that every three to five hours I'm going say because sometimes I can get to the five hour mark. I try not to overnight. It's definitely a little bit longer, but I have to pump. I tried to like come off of coming like pumping at night and I almost ended up with a clogged milk duck. Like I even had like the red streak coming up and I was so scared because I hear like horror stories. But I was able to like latch baby on completely all day on that one boob because baby really drains you more than like a pump would. That way like completely emptied out and then. But yeah, I mean pump. I'm not sure how old your baby is, but in the beginning is important to mimic their feeding schedule. I honestly didn't want like to like breastfeed exclusively. I've always knew I wanted to be a pumper but as time went I realized in certain situations and things it's just easier to put baby on the breast. Which also meant that I didn't have to pump that side. But yeah, try your best. As I always say, and even if you can only do, I've done, like, where I don't have a lot of time, and I'll just put them on for five minutes, like, because at least. At least it was on. At least my body was like, all right, some milk is leaving. And then if you're ever in a long car ride, I keep my pumps in depending on, like, obviously, like, if you are engorged, like, you're gonna fill up the cup right away. But if you're able to change the cup and keep them on and then keep restarting them and turning them off for a quick power pump, I do that. Like, I drove like an hour away and, like, I did it for literally every, you know, the power pump thing every 20 turn off and off or whatever. But that. So, yeah, I didn't do too many power pumps. Honestly, I could count on my one hand how many power pumps I've done. And the baby's four months old. But hopefully this answer your question, and hopefully it's not too much information, but I like to share what I feel like is important, even if it's not just to what you're asking.

So I go back to work on Monday from a six month maternity leave. I am pumping like 95% of the time and I don't want to lose that. I've worked too damn hard to get to four months of pumping to lose it for going back to work. So here are some expectations or boundaries I'm going to be setting when I do go back. So first thing I'm on a schedule. So I pump at 36912 3, 6, 912 night time. I don't always do but typically I for some reason wake up at three in the morning. So I pump then I pump at 6, 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm and 9pm so at work I will be pumping at 9am, 12pm and 3pm so it's only three times in the day that I'm going to be pumping. I'm going to say if there are meetings that I need to attend, if there something I need to go to, I will not be available for 30 minutes during that time and I will be attending via teams, via chat. You know, however it might be, I'm going to be very, very, you know, I'm just gonna say it because you have a right, we have a right, we are pumping moms. We can do these things, we can set those type of expectations. It's not a lot to ask. I do have my own office, so I'm very lucky in that sense. And I do have a fridge in my office so I don't necessarily need to worry about where to store my milk. I'm also going to be using the Sarah's Chiller. I've posted a couple of videos with that before and is truly the best thing in the world if you are on the go and you're pumping. So I'm going to be using that, I'll be using my fridge, I'll be using a portable pump. So I haven't quite decided which one I'm going to do yet. I love my LV pump. When it works, when it works, it is amazing. It's convenient, you tuck it in, you go, you can do anything. But when it doesn't work, it's really frustrating. So I'm definitely going to have my manual hand pump, my Medela hand pump available at all times and then my Boone Trove, the two little ones, just suction onto there. I'm gonna have those in my pumping bag as well. So probably do a video on what I'm taking with me. To work. I think visual probably be a little bit easier. However, my biggest thing is I'm going to be setting those expectations the first day that I go back from maternity leave. So you know, when I talk to my manager I'm going to say by the way, I am pumping. I don't need anywhere. I can do it in my office or if I'm traveling for I work at a hospital but I also go medical office to medical office. So if I'm going to be going from one medical office to another, I can just pump in my car. I really don't care. Like I'd rather do it that way than try and find somewhere. So yeah, we're pumping moms. We can do this. I'm not losing my damn supply. I have tried way too hard to keep up the supply and keep everything going for work to take it away from me. So that is what we're doing.","Back to work on Monday and I refuse to let my supply dip because of it #pumpingmom #pumpingmoms #pumpingatwork #pumpingmommaatwork #workingmom #exclusivepumping #exclusivelypumping #backtowork #maternityleave #parentalleave  Let's talk about setting boundaries as a pumping while I'm at work.

Let's talk about what my lunch as a teacher looks like and why you should thank your child's teacher. If you're a parent and your child goes to school and your child has a good teacher, you cannot thank that teacher enough. This is how a teacher's lunch kurga if he didn't know I have a 50 minute lunch. And we're just gonna ignore the fact that these are things that we're doing instead of actually having our lunch because that's what we should be doing. There's just like way too many things that we do as teachers during our lunchtime. Literally, someone's knocking on my door. There's too many things that we do. We could be having lunch with a student, whether it's a reward or processing with the student. We could be editing a lesson that didn't go as we planned, so we now have to switch up the second half of the day. We could be calling parents, responding to emails, checking in with teachers. Our lunch almost never goes as planned. If a parent comes in to pick up their child early and wants to talk to the teacher about how they're doing, guess what? God forbid I say no, this is my lunchtime. I can't talk right now. Teachers wear so many hats. And I'm not complaining about any of this because I love my job and I love the kids and I do it out of the goodness of my heart. But what bothers me is that teachers do not get the credit they deserve. We fit into many different hats and we are expected to and that is not fair. What about my lunchtime? What about me having to pump because I have a six month old and a toddler? What about me wanting to check in on my kids or just call my daycare center, look at the app and see how they're doing, respond to their pictures. What about me wanting to just call my husband? Or me just wanting to have some quiet time and eat my lunch in peace. Some days I can, some days I can't. And I get it comes with a job. Again, not complaining. I'm just letting you know if your child has a good teacher, you cannot thank that teacher enough. Because good teachers, great teachers and teachers that care and teachers that take the time out of their day to dedicate time to your child. You cannot put a price on them. That is not taught. There are so many things to do in a school. There is so much need and so much support that is missing in schools. It is not fair to children. It is not fair to teachers and one dear tip that I would give all parents that have children in school is to keep in constant communication with the teacher about what they are learning, what they are doing, how are they doing, how can you relate what they are learning or just how? What conversations can you have with your kid about what they are learning in school? Having constant communication and one shared view on your child's learning and where you want them to be and where the teacher's projecting them to be and what the teacher is doing to help them get there is amazing. I cannot stress it enough. I almost have to go get my kids so I'm going to take these off. Let's see how much I made. I generalize in this video but I am just speaking about my experience. Experience as a teacher for seven years. I am not speaking for all teachers. I pump for 20 to 30 minutes so I usually have to rush to bag my milk and run down to get my class.

Having a baby isn't as bad as literally everyone made it out to seem. Made it out to look to seem. I can't English, but you know what I mean? Like people were making it seem like I'm literally never gonna live life again. Like, granted, yes, I do stay home a lot, but I don't mind it genuinely, like, how is homebody for a little bit anyways? But like people made it to seem like I was never gonna sleep in my life ever again and that I was never gonna enjoy life and blah, blah, blah. Genuinely, my baby sleeps pretty good. Not gonna lie, knock on wood, not gonna jinx that. But my baby sleeps pretty well, obviously from her teething. There's times obviously where she won't, but that's usually like a two week period if anything. And it's not like it literally lasts forever. Like it's only for a little bit. And then she goes back to sleep on like normal, like throughout the night from like almost like 8 till basically we wake up for work, which is like 5, 6, 7 depending. And then on the weekend, if she wakes up at that time, we literally just bring her to bed with us, cuddle with her, and she stays asleep and then she wakes up like around again, like 9 or 10 depending. And sometimes she can sleep a little later than that. So I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal how people make you upset. Obviously every baby's different. But like, if you don't mind cuddling with your baby, they will most likely fall asleep. And I don't mind it. Like, it's not a problem with me. I thought I was gonna have an issue having her in bed with us because I'm like, oh my gosh, it's gonna ruin the intimacy between me and my partner. But like, really, we love cuddling with her. Like, plus they're only little this once and then when they're older, they probably won't want to cuddle anymore. You know what I mean? So, yeah, I just wanted to come on here and say that if you ever feel discouraged for having kids and thinking they're ever gonna sleep again. Like, I think the worst part, I personally think, was a newborn stage, like waking up every few hours to feed. And everyone says that the newborn stage is the easiest for me. It was not the easiest, it was the hardest for me. Like right now I'm doing a lot better because I've adjusted to like this new mom life. But like everyone's experience is different. Don't let that discourage you from yours. And chances are the newborn stage is a lot harder because I hate when everyone's like, it was so easy. The newborn stage is the easiest stage. Like, all they do is sleep now. I did not like the newborn stage. Well, I liked it. Just not liked it for sleep purposes, you know? But, yeah, I just want to come on here and say that because I'm pumping right now and nobody's talking to me, and I just wanted to talk.","I just talk to talk bc im lonley rn hehe #fyp #pumpingatwork #talkwithme #momtok #momsoftiktok #motherhood #newborn #3monthsold So I just want to come on here and say this. Having a baby isn't as bad as literally everyone made it out to seem. Made it out to look to seem. I can't English, but you know what I mean? Like people were making it seem like I'm literally never gonna live life again. Like, granted, yes, I do stay home a lot, but I don't mind it genuinely, like, how is homebody for a little bit anyways? But like people made it to seem like I was never gonna sleep in my life ever again and that I was never gonna enjoy life and blah, blah, blah. Genuinely, my baby sleeps pretty good. Not gonna lie, knock on wood, not gonna jinx that. But my baby sleeps pretty well, obviously from her teething.

So let's see how much. I got about 4 ounces. 4 ounces on my left. Since I got 4 ounces on my left, I'm not gonna put it back on that side because that's what I normally get. Let's see what's on the right side. Yeah, I feel like this is a lot, too. I'm gonna guess like seven and a half ounces. This morning I got, like, nine ounces, which I normally get. Probably like eight, seven and a half. So I was able to bag up some of that, which is pretty cool. And then the other ounces, my baby drinks in the morning. But, yeah, I'm about seven and a half ounces today. So happy pumping."

It's Tuesday and I have to go into the office for work today. It's my first full day back in the office and I don't know how long my husband was. Had long days for a while there. And so I was working part days in the office. But today we'll be there for a full day, which just sounds like a really long day. But on top of that, it's Halloween and my neighborhood has a costume contest tonight. And Landon is going to be Jack. Jack from the Incredibles. So. So I'm so excited for him. But the costume Contest starts at 5:30 and I won't be home before then, which makes me really sad. So I'm hoping that my husband will take him over just to participate in something because, you know, trick or treat starts at like, what, six? He's gonna be going to bed like probably 6:30, so he's not really gonna get to. Not that he would be like getting candy or anything anyway, but he like, can't really even sit out with us and pass out candy because he's falling asleep. So I want him to get some use out of his costume. So I'm hoping that he'll take him to the contest. He also can wear it to daycare today. I haven't decided if I'm gonna have him wear that or just like this little sweatsuit that has like bones all over it. Like he looks like a skeleton. Just because his costume is kind of big. I think the legs are really long and I just feel like him playing and stuff, like it's just gonna like get in his way. So I think he might wear something different. But I hope that you have a wonderful and safe Halloween and have fun trick or treating if that's something that you're doing with your family tonight. And then starting tomorrow, it's Christmas season. So we're going to be decorating this house for Christmas soon. I can't do it this weekend, so I'm gonna have to wait till next weekend.

So right now I'm just like reassembling all of the parts, putting the caps on the little stopper things together. So let me do that real quick. Okay, so I got all of those together and then I've got my six bottles right here. So she does six four and a half ounce bottles a day. And then I also nurse her right before bed. But I usually pump first so like she doesn't get that much. It's just more for comfort. And then I also nurse for comfort throughout the day. But like all of her nutrition and stuff comes from like bottles. So I do use the pitcher method. For me, that's just been the easiest, like exclusively pumping. I don't separate like evening milk and morning milk. I know some people say to do that. I really just don't think it's worth it for me anyway. And like y'all, I look a mess today because she got her two month shots yesterday and y'all already know that she was not in a good mood today. So just going to pour, just kind of eyeball a little bit, a little bit more. So now I'm going to go ahead and put the stoppers in all of them. I forgot to add her drops, but she gets one vitamin D drop and six probiotic drops. I put them in different bottles because six of the probiotic drops at a time is too much for. That was four, let's see, five, six, seven. Everything is camped. And this is what I have left. It's about 16 ounces. But I do have to pump one more time. So I'm gonna pump and then put that in there and then bag the milk pumping. And I'm definitely washing my hair tonight also. This is my husband's shirt and he works with a lot with chemicals and there's literally acid and like holes from the acid on the shirt. That's what I got. The bottom one's my right side and my right side is like usually my really good producing side. And she's been slacking today, but I think I had a clog come out earlier. Maybe that's why, I don't know. But I have the bag. I think I got like maybe 2 and 12 ounces for my left and like maybe 2, maybe less for my right. Going to give her a good old and then bag first bag. I like don't measure. I just pour until it like hits about six and then I call it good. I just get the air out of it.

How i store my baby milk. @Nanobébé #baby #babybottlereview #nanobebe #milkstoragetips ad - gifted ,"I come on to talk about the bottles that I use. This one is wash, but I had it in my hand, how good they are. They're made by nanobaby. Now. I used their milk bags, storage bags for milk. And these bottles, they were sent to me. But they are so good. Yeah, I used a different brand and then I think maybe she was around a month when my baby sent me the bottles and we've used them ever since. She's mainly breastfed, but has a bottle here and there now. But when she was born, she had a bottle daily, regularly in one bottle in the evening. Anyway. That's a whole nother story. If anyone was interested in what we do then I can always do a video about this. But anyway, I'm here to talk about the bottles, about how good these are. They're so cute as well. They come in all different colors. I think there's four colors available. But they're so nice because they're silicone. I don't know if you can see that they're squidgy and they're made to be so good in your hand. Oh, baby girl's not happy. One minute, I'm back. So yeah, these are so good. They anti colic silicone and they are really nice in the hand. You can hold them and they just are really, really good. We've really liked them. So I thought I'd just share because they're not one of the mainstream brands such as Tommy, Tippy, Mam, all those sort of ones. But they are really, really good and we've loved using them and especially. Well, I don't give her. Tend to give her a bottle so much. My fiance, when I'm out, he gives her a bottle and he really likes them. But I'll show you the milk bags now. I've tried a lot of milk bags. Yeah, I've tried a lot of milk bags because I produce a lot of milk. So I have like a freezer full of milk Anyway. So these are the freezer bags from Nano Baby. I've tried maybe four other brands. These were sent to me originally, a little like taster pack and they're really good and I've purchased them, repurchase them over and over and over again in this shape, which is a really unique shape. They're really good because. Which is really unique to nanobaby. You can store them laying flat in their like stone device. Wait, I'll go and get that as well. So this is what you. It goes in your fridge or your freezer. There we go. Like that. It's a bit hard to show. I've got multiple. Because I have multiple milk and then so I'm trying to hold. Big deal. You. Then once the milk is obviously in your thing, you then stick stack them up in there and it keeps them really flat to freeze and it's really good. So if you need some milk bag recommendations or how to store your milk in your freezer or fridge waiting to be used, get the nanobabies because they're really, really good. So they were all sent to me but months ago and I've just now thought I better share how good they are. Oh, gosh, my hair. But yeah, nano baby. Love them.

Let's pump. I am back at work today, guys. My staycation is over. So let's get back to a routine again. It's a little bit hard to put my pumps in because, hold on, it's. There's no car like right here. There's usually. That car is usually right here. And it's a little bit weird just whipping out my boob. As you guys can see. I am back, back at work, you guys. I didn't do anything, anything interesting. Hence why I didn't record over the weekend. I think I did post a cleaning a picking up like at 1 o'clock in the morning because I just could not sleep. So I was like, let me just pick up my baby stuff. But that's why I didn't post because I really didn't do anything. I popped off the eyelash extensions. I couldn't do it anymore. So I feel weird. I feel weird without them. But I couldn't. It. I don't know how to explain it. I just couldn't deal with like not cleaning my eyes or rubbing my face. That was annoying. So I'm honestly very curious to see how much milk I get. Because honestly, like, if I'm being completely honest with you guys, I did not pump well because I. There was no need for me to pump except for like early in the mornings, like around 7 or 8 because the baby needed to eat his breakfast. So like I would make him his cereal or peanut butter and I thin it out with my breast milk. But that's the only time and I was only getting an ounce. I want to see how much I'm gonna get like once I get home. I'm not going to lie, I miss my baby. I was with him a whole seven days. Like I kid you not. I go to bed, he'd wake up with me like hurt this morning because he woke up at like 6 and he felt me like I think getting ready and he wouldn't go back to sleep as much as I was like, no, you know, go back to sleep. But he did not want to. So that kind of broke my heart leaving him again. And I was like, damn, I really wish I did not have to come to work that like the nail business or the, the dessert business picked up. Because if I could leave this job to work from like home out of, you know, for myself, I'd a thousand percent like want that. But unfortunately that's not the case. So I'm stuck here, which I don't mind. It's just I'm not home with my baby. But that's enough ranting you guys, because see, no Lego where you're at. I'm scared. Kidding. But let's go home cuz I'm tired and I'm very hungry for whatever reason. But I'll see you guys at home. Hey you guys, I just got home.

I'm about to pump, but I figured I'd come on here and share little tips on what I've learned since I've started pumping. About three months now. It's crazy, I didn't think I'd last that long. But storing milk, that was one of the things I had to keep googling and I went on TikTok. TikTok's my Google, scrolling through all kinds of videos trying to figure out how to store milk or what's the requirements or whatever. So I figured I'd share what I know and what I do for my storing. So first, when you're pumping freshly pumped milk straight off the booth, it has a four hour shelf life. So it can sit on your counter or wherever for four hours before it has to be refrigerated. Once it's in the refrigerator, they said it can last up to four days in the refrigerator before it gets free frozen. Personally, I do three days. That's just what I'm comfortable with. On my third day, I bag it, freeze it. Once it's in the freezer, it has six months. I haven't reached six months to know what I feel comfortable with of how long I'll keep it in the freezer. But I'm actually donating milk. So I don't ever plan on keeping milk in the freezer that long. But it has six months in the freezer and I believe if you have a deep freezer it's up to 12 years. Six months in the freezer, 12 months in the deep freezer. So defrosting your frozen milk, you can either run it under hot water, feed it to your baby, or you can defrost it by putting it in the refrigerator. And it lasts 24 hours in the refrigerator. But the timer starts when the last ice crystal melts. So I've tried that before and every hour I was in the refrigerator checking to see if there's ice crystal. It took forever. It almost took like seven, eight hours just for it to complete defrost and then your 24 hours start. I didn't even feel comfortable with that. So I started my timer the second I took it out of the freezer. But it's up. Whatever you feel comfortable with. So pretty much everything I pump for the day, I'll put it in one jar at the end of the day or the next day I will put it in bottles for my son to eat and then I'll bag the rest. This batch right here, I'm actually just going to buy it and donate it. My son's waking up, so I'm gonna go. I haven't even started pumping yet. Yeah, I'm gonna go. So I'll talk to you guys later. Let me know if you have any questions. This is just what I've learned, what I picked up over the months or three months that I was breastfeeding.

The other thing I think about when I'm going out and about is just all about my timings. So usually when I go out, I try to go just after I've pumped and managed to clean my parts. This can like really help you get a bit more time when you're out. Also, if I am out over a couple of pumping sessions, I'll aim at that second pump happens on my way home. So I will possibly like do it in the car so that when I'm back I have my hands free, I'm mobile, I don't need to pump as soon as I've got back in case that baby wakes up from the car. That's a big one, getting in the house with the car seat and having to then pump when then she needs me. So there's a few things you can do around timings to kind of like prevent having to clean when you're out and stuff. Obviously no milk is wasted milk, so if you aren't able to clean your pumps and you're concerned about it, just save it for milk, milk bath or something. As long as baby has enough for that day. Five and a half and six and a half. So 12 for this morning.","Replying to @Em N🤍 this is what I do to clean on the go and how I think about timings before leaving the house 🥰💖 Hope this helps🥛🍼 #exclusivelypumping #wearablepumps #pumpschedule #pumpwithme #breastmilkoversupply #bagbreastmilk #nighttimepumping #daytimepumping #newbornbaby #newborn #fyp #sahm #momcozys9 #momcozypump #dayinthelife #momcozyuk #breastfeeding #breastfeedingjourney #momtok #babytok #breastfeedingtok #newmum #breastmilksupply #lactating #breastfeedingmama #momtips #lactationtips #maternityleave #spendthedaywithus #dadtok #medelabreastmilkbags #mambottles #momcozys12pro #moncozyreview #cleaningpumpparts #cleaningpumps #sterilisingpumps #miltonsteriliserwipes #miltonsteriliser  Come pour with me while I talk about pumping on the go.

Can you reheat a bottle after it's already been heated up? The answer to that question is no. Let's talk about why it's going to be a breeding ground for unhealthy bacteria once a baby's saliva hits the nipple. And it's also going to kill off healthy bacteria if you're reheating it a second time. So overall, no, it's not going to be good for baby. But if you're in that two hour window from the first time you heated up the milk and the milk's just cold, you can give baby cold milk. It's not bad for baby to have cold milk.

Yes, I still breastfeed and pump beyond a year of age. She feeds on demand when I'm available, so I use the willow go just getting them set up here. Fun fact is that breastfeeding beyond one year has excellent benefits for baby and mom. Additionally, breast milk content changes so it starts high in carbs and then transitions to being higher in fats and proteins as baby ages. So a smaller volume actually gives just as great a nutrient intake. So I don't produce as large volumes anymore as you can see here. I store it in 2 ounce increments for her daytime feeds and then I have a little extra here that I'm going to put in this little Haaka feeder toother which is great for when she's teething. Also, when you're storing in freezer bags, make sure to squeeze out as much air as you can. So that's that little Haaka teether. They're excellent. These will just go in my little freezer right away and I am going to remove the motors so that they can charge and then store the other pump parts in the fridge so I don't have to wash between pumps during the day. So that is a pump at work with me.

I don’t know what I will do with all this free time now 😂#workingmom #newmom #pumpingatwork #momtips #wearablepumps #pumpingonthego #momchats  If you could see em now, you'd be proud. But you think they's your be. Your funeral was beautiful I beg I heard you coming. The kids are in town for a funeral and the grass all smells the same as the day he broke your arm swinging on that kid out on the river. You bail him out. Never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's living. If you could see him now, you'd be proud. Where you think they going to be? Your funeral was beautiful Like I heard you coming."

Let's see what I can do in 15 minutes while wearing my Willow Go. The go has six pieces that you have to wash and reassemble per side before use. So it definitely has more parts than the 3.0. But because the whole pump breaks apart, I'm able to clean it a lot better. Okay, I just screw about four cup sizes. Let's see what I can do in 15 minutes. If I am going to wear a wearable pump, I do try to do as much as I can in that 15 or 20 minutes. Sometimes that means I don't get as much milk out in that time. But I'm able to do things that I wouldn't be able to do if I was connected to my wall pump. This morning I decided to get breakfast on, brush my teeth, fix a little spray tan problem on my neck, just do little things that I needed to get done first thing in the morning to start my day. So while my oatmeal is cooking, I'll usually make a drink. I've already had a coffee this morning. I drink about a gallon of water a day. But I have one of these. This is called a Hydro Mom. It's like a liquid iv, but it's from the brand Booby. So I'll make this. I just mix it with water and ice and I drink it first thing in the morning. We eat oatmeal probably about three to four times a week. Rolled oats is supposed to help boost your milk supply, but I just really like the taste of it. I'll put brown sugar, cinnamon and chocolate chips in it and it just tastes really good. It's a win win because it's good for me and my toddler will eat it too. Okay, 15 minutes is up. Left side, right side and my curve from this morning. So let's see what we got in this one first. About one and a half ounces. Okay, here is my right side. So I ended up with nine ounces. I'm going to separate this into two bags. One four ounce bag and one five ounce bag. So we have milk for when I go back to work.

Take it easy, and prioritize you and your baby's comfort. 😌💕 9️⃣ Pack Extra Supplies: Remember batteries or a charger for your pump, breast pads for leaks, and cleaning supplies for pump parts. 🛍️💧 🔟 Be Prepared for Security Checks: If you're flying, declare your breast milk, pump, and accessories at airport security. You're often allowed to carry more than the liquid limit. ✈️🧳 #PumpingMom #TravelTips #BreastfeedingJourney #MomLifeOnTheGo #NursingOnTheMove #TravelWithBaby #LaVieLactationMassager #MilkSupplyBoost #BreastfeedingMama #TravelPreparedness #MomsOnTheMove #HydrationStation #NursingCover #MomHacks #PumpLikeAPro #PumpingEssentials #MommyAndMe #TravelComfort #PumpAndGo #BreastfeedingSupport #PumpingOnTheRoad #MommyTraveler #TravelWithLove #MilkStorageTips Here are my top five traveling tips this summer as a breastfeeding or pumping mom. Plan ahead. Find comfortable places that you can breastfeed or pump. Bring your Lviv Warming Lactation Massagers. It combines heat and vibration to reduce pumping time. Prevents clogged ducts and mastitis. It improves milk letdown. So you can love your pumping and nursing journey, especially while you travel. Good vibes this summer. Make sure to grab your nursing bras. Pack a couple of extra tops in case of some leaks. Stay hydrated and fed. Remember to drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious foods and snacks. And make sure to bring proper storage coolers with ice packs. Breast milk can stay up to room temperature for four hours, but it's safer to keep it cooler."

So I store it in a mason jar, refrigerate it and then I combine it all once it's all refrigerated temperature and put it into this little pitcher. It's just easier for pouring. I tend to have a pretty fatty milk content, so make sure you're mixing all of that goodness together so you your baby gets all the good stuff. But I wanted to address a couple of things. I think that maybe I have created a false expectation unintentionally for what a milk output should be. First things first, everybody's different. Any amount of milk output is a good amount of milk output. So please don't compare my output to yours. Again. This is after a long stretch of not removing any milk, which explains the high amount.

So this is what I do. To each their own, so don't come at me. But when I'm nursing and I'm using my haaka, every feeding, whatever I catch I put into a bottle. Obviously, like you can tell I used this one. And then either sometimes I put it in the fridge and I let it cool and then I put it in here, or sometimes I just dump it in right away. Do what you're comfortable with. They say you're not supposed to mix milk. You can though, and it goes back and forth. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But that's what the pitcher method is. So all day long you whatever you catch or whatever you pump, you put into a pitcher. And then you can either make bottles at the end of the day, the next morning, all your milks combined. So like my first pump of the day is super watery, like lots of 4 milk. So when I combine it with the rest of the milk, it's not super watery. And like it evens out. And same with like AM and PM milk. A lot of moms are like, don't do that. Don't combine it or keep it separate because of the times. And I mean you can. But pitcher methods just easier. It's way less bottles in my fridge. And now like I have three jugs instead of this would be 8, 16, 24 bottles just for today, four 8 ounce bottles. But yeah, that's what the pitcher method is. You just collect whatever you pump or catch an oaxaca throughout the day and put it into one jug.","Replying to @ninacheyennegarci  • #breastmilk #breastmilktok #pitchermethod #ebf #oversupplymom #breastfeedingtok #breastfeeding #breastfeedingjourney #milkstorage #breastfeedingtiktok #exclusivelybreastfed  So what's the pitcher method?

I'm currently 10 months postpartum and I have been pumping since they were in the hospital. As you'll see, there's quite a bit of variation in how much I can pump every day. All of these clips are only my morning pumps and typically I pump at the same time every day as soon as we get up, which is normally right after 7. My pumps vary from 950ml to 1050ml. Sometimes I get close to 1100, but very rarely now when people see how much I can pump in the morning, I get a lot of questions asking what they can do to increase their milk supply. I know that it's so easy to compare yourself to somebody else, but just because this is how much I pump doesn't mean this is how much you should be pumping. I'm sure that having twins definitely impacts how much milk I can make. And I worked really hard to try and up my supply very early postpartum. When we were first in the hospital, I was unable to pump enough milk for them. I was an under supplier. I was only producing about half of the milk that I needed for my twins. And so I did a lot of power pumping trying to get my supply up before I hit the 12 week mark. And I was really lucky that I responded as well to power pumping as I did. I was able to get a slight oversupply and then once I got to that slight oversupply mark, I just tried to maintain that by pumping seven to eight times a day. Once I hit the 12 week mark, I did start dropping pumps. I have lost a little bit of my supply, but I was able to maintain a slight oversupply most of the time. So I've been very lucky that I've been able to freeze some milk so that I can start weaning a little early. And this ended up being eight morning pumps that I showed you. So my average was 993 milliliters or 33.5 ounces every morning.","Quite a few morning pumps!

The number one reason for a low supply is flat or inverted nipples. Most women with implants are still able to breastfeed. So far in the 60s, that was the lowest breastfeeding rate thus far. 60s, early 70s to be specific. Only 20 to 25% of moms breastfed. Nursing or breastfeeding triggers a hormone called oxytocin, which can create a breastfeed high, which relaxes you and baby. Your baby can pick your breast milk out of a lineup just by smell as early as 2 weeks old. On average, a woman makes 70 gallons of breast milk in their first year. That's over 250 liters if you are an exclusive pumper. So you don't nurse your baby and your baby starts to get sick and you want your breast milk to build those antigens for the baby, those antibodies. Instead of hooking your baby up, all you have to do is kiss your baby on the head. This will introduce what your baby needs into your lymphatic system and then your body will make the antibodies in your breast milk.","#AmazonVirtualTryOn #MakeASplash #psahm #breastmilk #liquidgold #workingmom #workingmom #oversupplymom #sanitizingpumps #savealife #momtiktok #spectras2 #spectrapump #exclusivepumping #cleaningpumpparts #pumpingmom #breastfeedingmom All right, so breastfeeding facts.

If they are, I just want to offer a reminder to help keep your baby out of the emergency department. Hi, I'm Gwyn, a pediatric emergency nurse and mom of two. Oftentimes babies that are formula fed are using powdered formula or formula that needs to be mixed with water to make the bottle appropriately. When this happens, it is very important that it's made to the recommendations of the manufacturer on the container. You don't want to add too much water or too little water. For example, some people to add little less water to try to get their baby to feel fuller by taking the same amount of feed to hopefully. Usually it's to help them sleep better. And sometimes because formula is expensive or you're short on the formula container, you can't get to the store. Whatever the case may be, sometimes people water down formula, adding too much water to the formula and trying to get it to last longer. Both of these can be dangerous to your baby. Because formula is made so specifically to give your baby's body exactly what it needs, the exact electrolytes and nutrients to help them grow. By adding too much formula or too much water, it can really affect your baby's electrolytes. For example, adding too much water into a baby's bottle or really giving them any free water at all can cause them to seize. It is decently common enough that if I have a baby specifically under six months old that comes in seizing, the first thing I ask is, how is your baby fed? Are they formula fed? Because most of the time that is the answer. So I offer this just as a reminder to try to mix your baby's bottle as close to the recommendations as possible. Now, a few drops of water extra or, or a few little pieces of formula extra here and there is. Okay, no one's making it exactly, exactly correctly, but you don't wanna be adding in extra intentionally. And if you're adding more water to the formula because you're having trouble affording the formula, please reach out to your pediatrician to see what resources they have locally to help you. If you wanna learn about more feeding tips, check out our course or our series and I hope this helps.","Formula is made so specifically to give a baby's body the nutrition and electrolytes that it needs to stay healthy and to grow.

Gonna change your bum bum. Okay, Change your bum bum. He hates this. No, he's just weeded on his own head and pooed everywhere. Little milky boy. Come mum. So it's 5:00 in the morning. He's actually not due for a feed yet, but he has his tongue tie appointment today, so I have to. I can't feed him any later than two hours before his appointment because they obviously like cross cry a lot and they don't want them to vomit and then like choke on it. He wouldn't go down last night until about 10 and then obviously he woke at 11:30 for a feed and then he went back down at 12:30, woke at 2:30, back down at 3:30. But I swear sometimes like even when this kid is asleep, I still can't sleep because he is so noisy and I just sleep so lightly now. I guess that's the joys of being a mum. He is going back down to sleep now. It's time for a shower. I have to watch him while I shower, otherwise I panic that I'm not going to hear him. Gotta put my pumps on because I fed him early, so I don't know, I didn't want to pump early just in case. So I'm gonna put them on now. Yes, I am still wearing maternity jeans. No, I do not care. They're actually a little bit big, so. But I can't fit into my other jeans yet, so maternity jeans it is. All right, pumps in. Let's put some makeup on, make myself feel a little bit more human. Okay. So I did get my lashes done which does help me feel a little bit more like myself and I don't know, just put together. Plus it's like super easy to do my makeup because all I really have to do is chuck on some concealer and it looks like I've made more of an effort than I actually have. It's just, yeah, night time he just, it's like putting him down for like that first stretch of sleep. He just doesn't seem to want to go down. But like throughout the actual night, like when he wakes up for a feed, he pretty good at going back down. It's just the initial getting him down in the first place. But he is only like two weeks old, so obviously he's still so new and little and he just wants his mummy. Sleepy boy. Okay, let's do something with this hair. I think I'm just gonna do like a little half up, half down. Check how much milk I made. Always spill it. That one was 90. This is just my measuring bottle. All the leftovers, which is another 90, so 180. So I usually just get, like, the leftovers in that container, and then once it's, like, fridge temperature, I combine it in a storage bag, and then I put all the storage bags in my freezer. So there's quite a bit. And I don't actually know what to do with it other than, like, milk baths, because I want to breastfeed. So I don't actually want to bottle feed anymore. So I don't actually know what to do with all this. So if you guys have any suggestions, let me know. Oh, here's another postpartum body update, if you guys want to see. Everything is still very skill, squishy and flabby, but we're getting there. I think I've lost my ass too. I'm kind of flat in the back now, so. Yeah, but that's what we're working with. 17 days postpartum. Also, this boob is just permanently bigger now, I think. Okay, all done. Ready for the day. Okay, I washed all these bottles, I pumped out his next feed, and now I'm scoffing down some porridge. And then I'm gonna attempt to get him dressed and leave in 20 minutes. Wish me luck. He's a bit cranky, but here's our outfit of the day. And he's got his little name badge on his nanny got for him. Now we're gonna go get in the car. The car will calm him down because he actually likes the car. Okay, we're all in the car, ready to go. And he has stopped crying because he loves the car, so. So the doctor's actually just taken him away so I don't have to watch. So we're sitting in a feeding room waiting for him to come out, and then I have a bottle ready to comfort him, so I hope I don't hear him scream through the door. He did so well. His tongue tie was actually bigger than what she thought in the first place, but he lifted his tongue up really well, so she was able to get, like, all of it. And now he's just having to feed. He didn't bleed or anything.

So today we're going to talk about freezing milk. I bag mine in 5 ounce increments and I pre measure it in a Spectra bottle. First I open the bag as wide as possible and then carefully pour in that liquid gold. Then I seal the bag about three quarters of the way. And I'm going to show you here about how much I'm leaving not closed. Then I slowly push the milk up so that it's essentially releasing all of the air bubbles out. And then I quickly seal it off. I'm always scared of leaks, so I end up putting it on the counter and then just making sure all of seals are closed. Then I read the date and how many ounces are in it. Next, I'm going to be putting anything that is frozen currently in the freezer into a Ziploc bag to basically create the milk brick. I label the bag with the dates of the milk that's going to be in it. It just makes it easier for when I'm going to go out to the freezer to know that I'm pulling the oldest milk first. I'm just using a normal gallon Ziploc bag here and I like to put one bag on the bottom to kind of act as a base and then I put the rest in. This is not a full milk brick, so it's going to have the that was frozen a few days ago as well as the milk that I'm freezing right now. I'm laying the milk that needs to be frozen as flat as possible and stacking some where necessary, putting the milk brick in the freezer. And now I'm gonna go pump before my daughter wakes up.","Here’s how I like to get all of the air out of my milk bags before freezing! 🍼#firsttimemom #ftm #exclusivepumping #exclusivepumper #overproducer #frozenmilk #spectrapump #baggingmilk #milkstorage #bagmilkwithme #freezerstash #pumpingmom #pumpingmama #milkbricks  Hey, guys.

I have, like, a very specific reason for that, and that is because if you were to watch any of my videos, like, my thing's always been that I want my supply to be very responsive to what my baby needs. This is why, since the very beginning, I've only ever pumped if my baby is getting a bottle. So for me to wake up in the middle of the night and do a full pump, I am really confusing my body. When you pump, especially when you pump all the way to empty, you're telling your body, your baby is hungry right now, and you need to be making not only the milk that you just made, but you need to be making more because you got to empty. So that means you might not even have enough. But my baby is sleeping from seven to seven, and I'm pumping one or two times in the middle of the night. My body is going to think that baby needs calories in the middle of the night. I'm gonna give that baby what it needs. And instead, what I'm trying to do is slowly tell my body, instead of needing those calories at night, my baby has what she needs at night to make it through several hours. And instead, that milk needs to be consumed during the day. This has been a slow and gradual process. She's gone from two wakings in the night to one kind of around the middle of the night to one kind of in the morning. And so throughout that time, instead of kind of manufacturing what I want my body to do, I'm just letting my body respond to exactly what my daughter needs. One of the techniques to getting your baby to sleep a little bit longer through the night is to make sure that they are super, super satisfied during the day. So as we've kind of been in this transition of getting her to sleep a little bit longer, I have been feeding her as long she wants during the day. And if you do that throughout the day, when it comes to bedtime, she's not starving. She finishes that last bottle, and she's ready to sleep. And when she's not eating, I will not wake up in the middle of the night, sacrifice my sleep, and confuse my body. If you do wake up super engorged, you can always pump just a little bit to kind of take the edge off. But do not pump all the way to empty, because that's when your body starts adjusting in order to compensate for that feed. And you really just want to relieve yourself without sending your body any messages. If you really focus on your baby's demand, your body supply will adjust to give that baby what it needs when it needs it.","Save your sleep and your supply! #pitchermethod #breastmilk #breastfeeding #pumping #pumpingmom #newmom #newmomtips #babysleep #milkstorage #milkstoragetips #momtok #handsfreepumping #milksupply  I've gotten a lot of comments asking why I'm not getting up and pumping in the middle of the night.

So this is my pump from last night. If you can see, it's almost like blue because it's super watery. And watery milk is not bad. It has a bunch of electrolytes in it and it helps keep your baby hydrated, but it doesn't really keep them full for very long. And this is my pump from this morning. It's kind of like yellowy and it's much fattier. If I were to just make a bottle out of this, my baby would probably pee a lot and have a lot of water in them, but they would be ready to eat right away. And if I just fed them with this, they wouldn't probably eat as much and they might have a stomach ache. So we put everything together in this massive pitcher. This is my pump from last night from one side and the other side. And then this is my pump from this morning from one side. So at night when my baby's asleep, I use my motif luna, which is just like kind of a standard pump, because I don't really ever need my hands at night. I'm just like sitting there getting ready to go to bed. But I use these mom cozy B1 hands free pumps in the morning because my baby's normally awake and I normally kind of have something that I need to be doing with my hands, even if it's just finding the Real Housewives episode that I missed last night on tv. Close this up and mix it up and make my bottles out of this picture. Tonight she'll use this bottle. She'll. She does six ounces at night. We give her a bigger bottle at night so that she can kind of load up and sleep as long as she can through the night. And then in the morning, we give her four ounces. And my husband does that so that I can sleep a little bit longer. And that is kind of the impetus to why I started pumping. And it has been a massive life changer. Every once in a while, she won't finish her nighttime bottle, but she always finishes her morning bottle. So I put her vitamin D drops and her probiotic drops in her morning bottle. By the way, if she doesn't ever finish a bottle or if you accidentally leave your milk out of the fridge, I have this ice tray in the freezer that makes 1 ounce little bars. And I labeled it bath milk. And if my daughter ever has like a rash or a diaper rash or something on her skin that's sensitive or irritated, we'll just drop a few ounces in her bath water.

The answer is yes, but there are a few things you need to know first. The Spectra site says that you can wash your pump parts in the dishwasher, but it can cause them to wear down a lot faster. So you may have to replace your pumps a lot more frequently if you're washing them in the dishwasher. And the other thing that you need to know is that these silicone parts, so both of these white parts, this one and, and then this one, they cannot go in the dishwasher. The preferred method to cleaning your pumps is to hand wash them. That's personally what I do. There has been maybe a time or two that I've thrown them in the dishwasher just when I needed a little extra help. But the best thing to do is to hand wash them. If you choose to wash your pump parts in the dishwasher, there is nothing wrong with that.

Mostly likely, you have high lipase milk.  This causes the milk to smell and taste bitter, soapy, our sour.

Cold temperatures, freezing and even refrigeration, can activate this enzyme which in turn changes the flavor.  It it however perfectly safe for baby to drink, but a lot of babies will refuse it because it’s not the sweet nectar they’re used to.  One way you can combat this is by deactivating the lipase prior to freezing it by scalding your milk.   Here’s what you do:  1️⃣ Pour freshly pumped milk into a saucepan on medium heat under you just start to see bubbles form around the edges (or 180 deg F). Do not let to come to a boil as this can deactivate nutrients.  Make sure it’s milk that had not been refrigerated yet as the lipase has already been activated by the fridge and it you’ll still get the lipase flavor once frozen, even if you’ve scalded it.  2️⃣ Immediately pour the milk into a container over ice to stop the cooking so nutrients aren’t deactivated.

I am currently getting packed up, ready to go. We're getting ready to leave on our cruise this coming weekend. We're leaving and it's a seven day or seven night, eight day cruise and we're super excited. But anyways, we're packing up, getting ready to go and the whole like navigating the cruise, airplane, all of that kind of stuff, it's brand new to me with a baby. So I'm taking in all the hacks I can get. And I saw this one on Tick Tock actually my friend sent it to me and it seemed like a great one. And we're gonna give it a test try for cleaning bottles. So when we went to Dollywood a couple months prior, that was his first little trip. We were in a hotel room and we had a super hard time washing all his bottles. It was like a disaster. Like we had like dish drags sitting out and trying to like keep them all up low. Well, I got smarter this time and I ordered a collapsible bottle station type thing, which I'll show it to you here in a few. But then I saw on Tick Tock, instead of like having to take soap and all of that kind of stuff and having stuff to wash, like dish rags and blah, blah, all that just ickiness for sanitation reasons, there's hack. So you go and you buy sponges just like hay. Okay. And then you literally. I've already drizzled these, but you drizzle them with dawn soap or baby soap, whatever you use for washing bottles. So I'm gonna let this dry for about an hour or two and come back to it. When I come back to it, I'm basically going to cut these up and put them into a Ziploc baggie. So then I have literally a fresh new sponge with soap already on it to wash all those bottles at the end of the day and then put on the drying rack. So I'm gonna let these set and then I'm gonna show you in the meantime what drying rack we got. Okay. So I got this little drying rack. It's the Munchkin brand and it was $7 from Walmart. It's super, super thin, really easy to use. But all you literally, it's like collapsible, so you can see like it's literally down right now. And all we have to do is pop these up. So like for the bottles and then it's just for like the little, the nipples and whatnot there. So we'll have the sponges like clean all of that and then just be able to plop and let them dry overnight and then be ready to go the next morning. Okay, I'm back. These are now pretty much dry with soap in them, so I'm going to cut them in half and put them in here. So let's go, because. And there we go. And I can just pack this and I can just grab a sponge, wash the bottles, and then toss it away at the end of the night and don't have any mess or have to worry about things being disgusting. So, yeah.","Hack for washing bottles on a cruise! #fyp #pov #babybottlewashing #cruiselife #cruisetips #momsoftiktok  Hey everybody. I am currently getting packed up, ready to go. We're getting ready to leave on our cruise this coming weekend. We're leaving and it's a seven day or seven night, eight day cruise and we're super excited. But anyways, we're packing up, getting ready to go and the whole like navigating the cruise, airplane, all of that kind of stuff, it's brand new to me with a baby. So I'm taking in all the hacks I can get. And I saw this one on Tick Tock actually my friend sent it to me and it seemed like a great one. And we're gonna give it a test try for cleaning bottles. So when we went to Dollywood a couple months prior, that was his first little trip. We were in a hotel room and we had a super hard time washing all his bottles. It was like a disaster. Like we had like dish drags sitting out and trying to like keep them all up low. Well, I got smarter this time and I ordered a collapsible bottle station type thing, which I'll show it to you here in a few. But then I saw on Tick Tock, instead of like having to take soap and all of that kind of stuff and having stuff to wash, like dish rags and blah, blah, all that just ickiness for sanitation reasons, there's hack. So you go and you buy sponges just like hay. Okay. And then you literally. I've already drizzled these, but you drizzle them with dawn soap or baby soap, whatever you use for washing bottles. So I'm gonna let this dry for about an hour or two and come back to it. When I come back to it, I'm basically going to cut these up and put them into a Ziploc baggie. So then I have literally a fresh new sponge with soap already on it to wash all those bottles at the end of the day and then put on the drying rack. So I'm gonna let these set and then I'm gonna show you in the meantime what drying rack we got. Okay. So I got this little drying rack. It's the Munchkin brand and it was $7 from Walmart.

I have been so much more prepared this time because of educating myself and I couldnt be prouder of our journey!🫶🏼😊 Late night pump using one of my favourite pumps right now the V1 momcozy (link and discount code in bio) she is so strong but comfortable enough to work your way up to those higher settings! If you need a solid pump that is portable and has a nice strong suction with vibration, this is a great option! As you can see i have been pairing it with my medela cups and they make a fantastic duo! #milksupply #viral #milkstorage #mumtok #milksupplyincrease #howtoincreasesupply #bagmilkwithme #bagmilk #pourmilk #pourmilkwithme #pourwithme #breastmilkpouring #pouringbreastmilk #milkpouring #pouringmilk #freezerstash #freezedriedmilk #breastmilktips #supplyhacks "

Also, if you do have a dishwasher, it is perfectly fine to put your baby's bottles in a dishwasher, especially if you do have a hot water cycle. If you have any questions, as always, do not hesitate to ask in comments. We're here to help you with any breastfeeding issues or pumping issues that you may be having, so please reach out."

I'm not even gonna try to pour it in here because I think I'll overfill it. So it's just not even worth it to make the attempt. I overslept this morning. I always get up at 5am to do my first pump of the day. Like no matter what happens yesterday, start my day at 5am because that's when we do like shift change, so to speak. My husband does all of Lordy's overnight feedings and then I start taking care of Lordy at 5am So I just do my pump at 5am too. And today I overslept until 6:30. I can tell I really needed to sleep.

I just want a good like five and a half, six hour stretch of sleep overnight. If I could have that, we would be money. We would be good Money. Like this 3 and 12 hour is not cutting it. Not at all. So that pitcher of milk pretty much exactly made all of the bottles I need to make for today. And this is what? I'm freezing. I think this is about 5 and 12 ounces. Nice. We did it. Okay, bet. Now we are all set with everything. I have all of the milk bottles. I have this frozen for the freezer. Frozen for the freezer. I have this bagged for the freezer.

I just thought five bags. I've never had a leak. I don't know, maybe there's a bad batch out there or something. But I never have any issues. And we are making nine bottles. All right, and let's start. Let's start filling these bottles. I think after this, now that my husband is on baby duty, I will get on the peloton and get the stress of this morning off of me because it has been. It's been a doozy. It's crazy how things can be so easy one day and so hard the next day. Like, that's probably the hardest part of motherhood for me so far is like, the unpredictability. Like, I don't do that well when things are so unpredictable. I like to be really in control. I let this thaw a little bit longer than last time so it's not quite so icy. Remember last time I just had to like, spoon out the milk in the last bottle. Oh, come on. I might have to do that again. We'll see. And I did need the spoon. This one is like. Sorry. This one. This one is like all ice. Okay. And I ran out of time. But here's all my bottles. They're going in the fridge. Frozen meal Friday."

I actually have therapy today. I am a regular therapy goer every two weeks for a few years now. Probably like five years. Ish. But I have not been to therapy since Lordy was born. Even when I was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before he was born, I still make. I still maintain therapy. I just did it like telehealth instead of going into the office, you know, because I couldn't leave the hospital. But once he was born and he was in the nicu, like, I really just didn't have time for it. And then we ran into the holidays, and then I was ready to go back to therapy after the first of the year, but my therapist was on vacation. So now we are finally meeting back up today, and I have to leave in almost exactly two hours. So that means I have two hours for Lordy to wake up so I can feed him, change him, and put him in his daytime clothes because he's still in his pajamas from last night. And then I need to blow dry my hair. I don't think I have time to blow dry my hair before he wakes up again, so I'm just gonna keep it in the towel until he's ready. I feel like I can accomplish those two things in two hours, though. But you never know. Things go off the rails in this house all the time lately. Ever since the baby was born, time is a little meaningless. Oh, I do need to pump in that time too. I almost forgot about that. In the next two hours, I need to feed the baby, put them in clothes, bludgeon my hair, and pump before I leave for my appointment. Look at this. I'm actually freezing. This is a lot of milk to freeze. Now, granted, I only made seven bottles, so that was an extra 3 ounces, but I think even without that, this is kind of a lot to freeze. This is, like, looks like exactly a cup and a half. Yesterday was probably close to the most milk I've ever pumped in a day. I don't know exactly because I don't keep track of how much I'm pumping unless I'm doing a what I pump in a day video. Those are the only days I actually track how many ounces and, like, keep a running total. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting. God damn it. As long as I. Otherwise, as long as I'm getting 3 ounces per pump, I like. I don't stress about it. I. I'm good because that's what he's eating per day. So If I do 3 ounces of pump.

Let's make Lordy's bottles for the day. Fair warning, I may have to cut this video short because I don't know how, but this kid is still sleeping and he should have been up like 20, 30 minutes ago. So we'll see if I can get this done. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We're doing nine bottles. And I'm really proud of myself cuz look at all this milk from yesterday. I made more than the pitcher again. I guess I should have bought the bigger pict, but it had been like six weeks of me not making a ton of milk, so I thought the 1 quart was good enough, but I guess I should have gone with the two quart. But maybe my supply will drop when I drop my middle of the night pump. So maybe it's not even going to be an issue, you know? And today would have been my due date. Can you believe it? I have had this baby for seven weeks now. If my water hadn't broken at 30 weeks and I gave birth at 32, 5, whenever I would have been like, giving birth. Like now I can't. I can't even, like, picture that. Like, I know there's a lot of danger in a premature baby and I wish he hadn't, like, gone through that. I wish he hadn't gone through the nicu. But I do appreciate that I've gotten to spend so much extra time with him, you know, like, I would not. I would be like, meeting him right now. And now I already know him. Like we're besties already. So. So I guess for every bad thing I went through this pregnancy, that is the silver lining that I got to spend so much time with my son. So much extra time. This pregnancy was a really rough ride. So I guess I'm just trying to find like, the upside in it. There wasn't a lot of upside, but this is like the one thing. All right, we have nine bottles. Let's get them out of the way. And this is what I'm bagging up to freeze. It is a little bit over. It's probably about like 10 ounces. This is a cup and this is the cup and a half line. So we're like right in between, probably 10 ounces. And I'm using these Lansino bags. I really like these. A couple people have said that they had problems with these bags leaking when you saw them, but I've thought a bunch of them at this point and I have not had any trouble at all. Like, they've given me no issue. A little bit more. So far, I've liked everything I've gotten from Lanso. I have, like, a few different items. I should make a video and show you guys, like, the stuff I have have and what I like. Okay. And this is all of yesterday's milk. This is nine bottles for him to drink today and two bags for the freezer.","#makebottleswithme #firsttimemom #preemiemom #exclusivepumping  Good morning. Let's make Lordy's bottles for the day.

So I don't know if you guys can see the little, the detail of the little penguin on here. And then it's like a little flower sprout. And it has like this. So like I was saying earlier about if you wanted to do purees, it has a little spot right here. And this is all silicone by the way. And then also pop it off like that. So. And it also has the millimeters on here as well. It's kind of hard to see cuz there's a glare. But it has like the millimeters on, you know, say how much you want to hold here.

So if you need to do like purees or anything like that. And then this one could be an actual storage container. Container, same concept. It's just that the capping is different, mind you. These are all silicon. Then also too. This is not the only one she's in. So hold on. Okay, so I went ahead and opened the other one off camera. But this one, it comes with a little spoon sprout.

Yeah, these are really, really cute. Now to move on to the actual pump itself. It does have an LED screen. As you guys can see up here. It has the timer to let you know how long you were pumping. So that way if you're gonna pump for X amount of minutes, it has that on there. Four molds, and it has 12 gears. So let's go ahead and open it. So here is the pump itself here, if you guys can see it. I love the setup of it. Here's the LED screen right here. I have to. I do have to charge this. That way I can go ahead and show you guys all the different settings. But look, I don't know if you guys can see that, but it has, like, a little anchor right here. Look at that hand screen. And you can set it up. There it is at a different angle. I love that. I love that. Thank you again to the for sending me over all these products.

I primarily nurse and have an oversupply that is lowering.  #nursingmom #breastmilk #breastfeeding #9months #nursing #milksupply #ebf #oversupply #breastpump #milkstorage #workingmom #pumpingmom ,"All right, we're gonna do picture method for very slight over suppliers. So my name is Lisa. I am primarily a nursing mom but I do work. So when I'm away from my daughter I pump and I have a very slight oversupply. I had more but it's been lowering. So today is the day that I've been working from home but my daughter is at the babysitter so I am pumping when I'm not with her. So I have milk from the last two days. So today and yesterday I was away from her yesterday as well. So this has been in the fridge chilling and then this what I pumped actually a couple hours ago, but I didn't, I didn't put it away yet. So the way the pitcher method works is that you just pull together your milk from a couple days and then bag it or put it in bottles all together. That way the nutrients are just more evenly distributed. All that fun stuff. Now some people do separate AM and PM milk, but my daughter sleeps really well and I don't really see a difference between nursing sessions with her. So I'm not going to separate it, I'm just going to do it as one. So because I've had an oversupply for so long, I have a big stash of milk in my deep freeze. I've actually gone through a lot of it lately because I do sell my breast milk as well. So I probably only have maybe 200 ounces in there, maybe 300 compared to like a thousand that I had before. So whenever I do the pitcher method and I freeze this milk, all this milk right here is basically all going to be frozen. When I am not with her, I send frozen milk with her to her babysitter. So that goes first in, first out and then I take it back. She does have some fresh pump milk once a week on Wednesdays her aunt, my sister in law comes over to watch her. So instead of having her thaw out milk, I just leave a pitcher in the fridge for her and she pours from there. So I'm currently working on the milk that she will use tomorrow. Wednesday, today is Tuesday. So this is what she's going to work through. So far now this milk has not been in the refrigerator so it's not the same temperature. So I'm not going to combine it just yet later. This is not screwing on well. So I think the inner ring is a little bit off. There's the inner ring also. I love these little screw tops. So some people like to use those like Mr. Brown's formula pictures for me. They don't. It doesn't make sense because still going to use mason jars after I'm done breastfeeding, that picture I'm not going to use. So I do have these linked in my storefront if you want to check it out. And then to save myself on dishes, I'm going to use this jar that I used earlier and pour my pump from before. So this was a pretty, pretty good pump considering that my supply has been lowering. This was my first pump after nursing and so my daughter nursed this morning and then I pumped three hours later and I got four ounces on each side, so I got eight ounces total. So that is definitely good. She has been taking anywhere between 6 to 8 ounces per bottle. So it could be an oversupply, it could not be. She's also taking in solids. So I think that like if I keep up this amount, I'm gonna be back into an oversupply because she is not taking in as much milk. So there we have it. This is two days worth of milk. So this is gonna go in the fridge. My sister in law is gonna pull from this one first for Beth's bottles tomorrow and then I'll continue adding to this into some big Thursday night after I'm done being away from her, then I will bag this milk. So I typically bag Thursday night and Sunday night. So Thursday night after my first stretch of working away from the house and then Sunday night so I can start the week off good. So there we go. Talk to you later.","How I set up my milk while I pump away from my baby.

My fridge got totally out of hand over the weekend because I wasn't keeping up with cleaning my bottles. So I ended up pumping a bunch into smaller Medela bottles. And on top of that, my twins are eating a lot less milk right now. So I have a lot of excess milk in the fridge that I have to take care of. I started by gathering all of the bottles of milk that I had in the fridge. I sorted everything. I put the milk that was just freshly pumped from today back in the fridge to make my bottles for tomorrow. I made all of the bottles that I had ready to go that were clean. I started this out the way I normally would. Normally I freeze 100 mils at a time. I froze in a couple different amounts and I always found that that froze well. But then I saw how much milk I had to freeze. I ended up with 2600 milliliters to freeze here. So after I divided it all out and I was taking a look at what the total was going to be, I decided I was going to just try and freeze it at 200 mils in each bag and see how it worked out. I honestly wish I would have just taken the extra time to write out more bags because this did not freeze flat at all. Now it's going pretty wonky when I try and put it into my deep freeze, but it's already done. And now next time I know just to freeze it in the 100 mils that I have been doing, because that's what freezes the flattest.

My fridge got totally out of hand over the weekend because I wasn't keeping up with cleaning my bottles. So I ended up pumping a bunch into smaller Medela bottles. And on top of that, my twins are eating a lot less milk right now. So I have a lot of excess milk in the fridge that I have to take care of. I started by gathering all of the bottles of milk that I had in the fridge. I sorted everything. I put the milk that was just freshly pumped from today back in the fridge to make my bottles for tomorrow. I made all of the bottles that I had ready to go that were clean. I started this out the way I normally would. Normally I freeze 100 mils at a time. I froze in a couple different amounts and I always found that that froze well. But then I saw how much milk I had to freeze. I ended up with 2600 milliliters to freeze here. So after I divided it all out and I was taking a look at what the total was going to be, I decided I was going to just try and freeze it at 200 mils in each bag and see how it worked out. I honestly wish I would have just taken the extra time to write out more bags because this did not freeze flat at all. Now it's going pretty wonky when I try and put it into my deep freeze, but it's already done. And now next time I know just to freeze it in the 100 mils that I have been doing, because that's what freezes the flattest. Once I had it divided out, I just poured it into the bags that I had written out already, squeeze all of the air out of it and lay them flat. And so this is what it looks like for my entire week's worth of oversupply. This ended up being 2, 600 milliliters, which is 88 ounces. And I just pop that into the freezer and I'll transfer it to my deep freeze next week."

As an exclusive pumper for twins, this has actually been a pretty easy transition for me dropping this pump. I haven't been super uncomfortable at all, just the first couple days. And then after about the third day, I was fairly comfortable again. I did lose quite a bit of my supply, but I was expecting going into this that I would lose quite a bit of my supply. I used to make about 2200 mils a day. Sometimes it would drop down a little bit depending on what was going on, but normally that's how much I was getting. And now this week, I've been ranging between about 1700 mils to 1800 mils. And anything within that range is going to be totally fine. It's almost more than what my twins are eating. And I really don't mind dipping into my freezer stash now, especially if I can maintain two pumps a day like this for a couple more months until I'm ready to completely wean. So at this point, we're just kind of waiting and seeing what's going to happen. Hopefully my supply doesn't drop anymore from what it is and I can maintain this much. If my supply keeps dropping as the weeks go on, I will throw the third pump back in. But so far, I'm really enjoying not having to pump during the day. I really do feel like I'm getting a lot more things done during nap times and stuff like that. So my totals for the fifth day were 925mils for my morning, in my evening pump. For the sixth day, I ended up getting 975 in the morning and 8, 25 in the evening. And the last day I got 925 and 875. So that's a total update for the seven days following me dropping to the two pumps a day. And in total, just because of the volume that I do pump, I have been pumping for just under three hours a day. I know that's a long time. An hour and a half in the morning and just under an hour and a half in the evening.","Days 5-7 dropping from 3ppd to 2ppd! #pumping #momsoftiktok #mom #momtok #baby #sahmlife #SAHM #momlife #twins #exclusivepumper #twinmom #breastmilk #exclusivepumping #oversupplier #oversupplymom #pitchermethod #bottlefed #freezerstash #freezingmilk #milktok #milksupply #milkstorage #elvie #elviestridepump #elviestride  Here are days 5, 6, and 7 from dropping from 3 pumps a day to 2 pumps a day.

Second piece of advice is that you can save time and effort by refrigerating parts between pump sessions throughout the day. Cleaning can be saved for the end of each day.  #pumpinghack #breastfeedingtips #breastfeedingjourney #breastfeedingtok #lactation #lactationconsultant #humanmilk #pumpingmom #pumpingatwork #momlife #workingmom #doctormom #doctormomlife #obgyndoctor ",NA,"Tired of endlessly cleaning your pump parts?

Today I'm tackling, cleaning, and sanitizing all of the bottles, pump parts, and pacifiers for our little girl. I first started by making room for all of her bottles in our kitchen. I have a huge mug collection, so I decided which ones I wanted to keep out and which ones I wanted to put away in storage. After getting that bottom shelf cleared, I just went ahead and disinfected it. I got this collapsible sink basin from Amazon, and the thing I love about this one is it has its own drain. After I put some soap and hot water in there, I set up the cleaning station, and then I moved on to my first round of cleaning. There was a lot more that needed to be clean and sanitized than I originally thought, so I ended up having to do about four parts. But this is the first part. After cleaning all of them, I just put them on the drying rack and I opened up our sterilizer. We went with the Philips Avent sterilizer. And honestly, I am so happy with this. And it worked amazing. It has an automatic setting which sterilizes and dries everything, and I was very surprised at how dry they actually came out. Plus, you can load this thing with so much. The one thing I was really kind of concerned about cleaning was the tubes there for my breast pump. And if you have any suggestions on how to clean those really well, please let me know. While it was sterilizing, I moved on to round two of washing. Because of the baby registry boxes that I got in the mail, I have a bunch of different bottles to try out, so. So you'll see a bunch of variety here. And I can tell you right now that the pregnancy back pain was real. While cleaning all of this, it was much more time consuming than I originally thought it would be. While the sterilizer was still drying, I decided to put down a clean towel and go for part three of cleaning. This one had basically all of the pacifiers, duck bills, and teethers. I then unloaded the sterilizer and put in the second load. Finally, on the last round of cleaning, and this one was basically all of the bottles that we purchased, we decided to go with the Philips Avent Natural bottles that are made out of glass. I personally feel like they're just a better option to the plastic, and I'm really excited to see how our baby likes them. I went ahead and loaded the sterilizer for round three. And after round three was done, this is what the last round looked like. After everything was clean, sanitized and dried. I put all of the bottles together so that I could put them away and I have heard that things only stay sterilized for about two days. I am 100% prepared to do this again. This just is something I really wanted to do to feel ready for her to get here. I then organized all of her bottles into the cupboard. I'm super happy that we have lots of options in case she doesn't like one. And after that I went ahead and put all of the pump parts into this container and this is a sterilization basket for the dishwasher that I decided to add there as well and I love how everything turned out. Next I put together my pumps. I decided to add these into my bedside cart instead of an extra bottle and a haka. I just think it is going to be easier for me. And last I put all of her pacifiers into this sterilized container and displayed them on her dresser and that's everything.","This process took forever but I am so happy to have it all done! 🥰 #37weekspregnant #pregnanttiktok #pregnancytiktok #nesting #day14ofnesting #nestingday14 #firsttimemom #mamatobe #fyp #foryoupage #pregnancyjourney #ftm #pregnant #pregnantmama #babybottle #babybottles #babybottlecleaning #babybottlesterilizer #philipsavent #philipsaventbottles #drbrownbottles #sterilization #cleaningpumpparts #organization #babyorganization  Welcome to day 14 of Nesting.

So let's try this again. This is an awesome question. We're gonna answer it per CDC guidelines. If it's freshly pumped, it's good for up to four hours. If you put in the refrigerator, it's good for up to four days. I keep mine in the refrigerator for only three. If you put it in the freezer. If it's one of the, like, kitchen fridge freezers, it's only good for six months. If you put it in a deep freezer, it's good for 12 months. If you thawed it, it's good for one to two hours. If you thought it and put it in the fridge, it's good up to a day. Never refreeze thawed milk. Never. And then if it's left over in a bottle from a baby's feeding, it is only up. It's only good for up to two hours. Second part of that question, storage bags. I used to use parent's choice. I loved these, but they no longer sell it. So now we use Medela. And I'll show you what those look like. Okay, this is what the storage bag looks like. You put the name. Because if it's going to a daycare, you put the date. Some people put the time. I just put the date. And then you put the amount that you have going into the bag. So how many ounces now? Do not go by the ounces that are in this storage bag. Always put the ounces from the bottle onto the bag. Because these storage bags, they lied to you. They're never right. Always use the bottle, ounces to write on the bag. Here is a bag of my breast milk. I have the date and then the ounces. And notice there is no air in the bag. Sure. You get as much of the air out as possible. It just helps with preserving the milk. I gotta go put this back down in the deep freezer. So I will show you how to store your breast milk once it's in the deep freezer. So I know a lot of people go and use the gallon bags and group these together and then write on the bag like, hey, this is 50 ounces. I don't do that. But you can do that. I just use a box, I put it in the freezer, and then I go from oldest to newest. Always go from oldest to newest. You always want to use the oldest milk first, and that's how you store it.","Reply to @little.mama96 I hope this helps ❤️ #milkstorage #storage #pumpingmom #pumpingtips #breastfeedingmom #pumpinghacks #pumpinglife #SyncYourMiO So I filmed this once, and TikTok would not put it up because I had cleavage showing.

Here is a bag of my breast milk. I have the date and then the ounces. And notice there is no air in the bag. Sure. You get as much of the air out as possible. It just helps with preserving the milk. I gotta go put this back down in the deep freezer. So I will show you how to store your breast milk once it's in the deep freezer. So I know a lot of people go and use the gallon bags and group these together and then write on the bag like, hey, this is 50 ounces. I don't do that. But you can do that. I just use a box, I put it in the freezer, and then I go from oldest to newest. Always go from oldest to newest. You always want to use the oldest milk first, and that's how you store it."

But exactly how long is breast milk good for? Well, according to the cdc, breast milk is good for four hours once it is pumped and left out at room temperature. Make sure that the temperature is no higher than 77 degrees. If you choose to store it in the refrigerator, it is good for up to four days, as long as you store it in a clean container and you maintain it at a temperature lower or at 40 degrees. Now, if you freeze it, it's good for up to six months in premium condition, but can last up to 12 months if stored away in a refrigerator that is not frequently accessed. Once you thaw breast milk, you wanna make sure you use it within 24 hours. Now, once you start feeding a baby milk that has already been thawed, if the baby does not finish it within that feeding, you want to offer it again within two hours from the start time of giving that bottle. Now, should you choose to warm up the milk before giving it to your baby, make sure you're doing so in a container that has warm water in it and not in the M.

Today's topic. Milk storage. I've had so many questions about how to store your milk, the pitcher method, how to bag your milk, how to freeze your milk, how long can milk be in the fridge? So we're going to talk all those things today. First up, let's talk storage time. Freshly expressed breast milk right off the pump, you just pumped it. It's good sitting on your kitchen counter for four hours. Within that four hours, you need to either feed it to your baby or you need to put it in the fridge, or you need to put it in the freezer. You can put it in the fridge at 3 hours and 59 minutes. 4 minute thing is very good because if you're lazy like me, that means sometimes you're going to have your milk sitting out for that good four hours and you'll go put it in right at the last minute. Once that milk has been put in your fridge, it is good for four days in the fridge. Feed it to your baby. Three days, four days. Needs to either go in the freezer, be dumped, or be fed. Once you put that milk into the freezer, if it is in a normal freezer, it is good for six months. You put it in a deep freezer, it is good for 12 months. Once you take that milk out of the freezer, you can either run it under hot water and heat it up right then and there, or you can put it in the fridge to thaw. If you run it under hot water right then and there to feed it to your baby, it is good for two hours. Once it's been heated up, at the end of that two hours, you have to dump it. You cannot put it back in the fridge, you cannot put it back in the freezer after you've heated it up once. If you thaw frozen milk in the fridge, it is good for 24 hours. That 24 hour timer starts when the last ice crystal melts. After the last ice crystal has melted in that bag, you cannot put it in the freezer, you cannot refreeze it. That milk has to be used within 24 hours. At the end of that 24 hours, that milk has to be dumped. If you have milk that you put into the fridge and then the next day you're like, oh, shoot, I didn't mean to put this milk in the fridge. If there still is any ice crystals in it, you, you can put it back in the freezer. If that last ice crystal has melted, it cannot go back in the freezer thing. If you're going to feed freshly expressed milk to your baby, so you just pumped milk, you put it in a bottle, you start feeding your baby. That milk cannot be put in the fridge once your baby's mouth touches the bottle. As soon as their mouth touches the bottle, bacteria is introduced and it has to be fed to them within that. You can go four hours still, but it has to be fed to them within that four hours or dumped. So a couple rules of Once baby's mouth has touched a bottle, that milk has to be dumped if baby doesn't finish it. Whether or not that milk is dumped after four hours or two hours depends on if it's freshly expressed breast milk or if it's reheated milk that was either frozen or in the fridge. Another rule of thumb cannot refreeze milk under any circumstance. It can be frozen once, it can be heated up once after it's been frozen. Once you have to use it or dump it. After it's been heated up, you have to use it or dump it. I like to freeze my milk in five ounce quantities because that's what my baby drinks and so it's easy enough to just run it under hot water and give it to him. If you want to bag in different quantities, that's fine, but you're going to have to thaw it in the fridge because in order to thaw it, you have to run it under hot water, which means it gets heated up and that means you need to feed it right away. Can't go back in the fridge or freezer. I personally already had a freezer stash before I started exclusively pumping and I wanted to use that freezer stash first. So I've been using frozen milk to feed the baby and then use the oldest frozen stuff first. What questions have I not answered? What questions do you have? Milk storage. How long you can feed milk to your baby, how long it's good for. I think I covered mostly everything, but let me know in the comments if you have other questions.","Breastmilk storage rules (as recommended by the CDC) and tips that have worked for me! #pumpingmom #milkstorage #pumpingmom #pumpingjourney #pumpingtips #breastfeedingjourney #exclusivelypumping #pitchermethod #momsoftiktok  It's milk bagging time, which means it's time to talk.

Since I'm pumping less than 6, I will put my ice and a splash of water in the outer chamber and keep my milk cool in the inner chamber. This is the perfect setup for pumping on the go or pumping at night because the breast milk chiller keeps your milk cold for at least 20 hours. After you're done pumping, you can do an ice check and place your freshly pumped milk into the inner chamber.

What I didn’t know as a first time mom. ,"Do you know what water you should be using when you're making your baby's bottles? There's a lot of different ways that you can do it. So I'm just going to tell you what I personally did. So I changed how I did it as my baby developed and became healthier and stronger. But when he was first born, I would use fridge water and I would pour into a kettle and boil it for 30 minutes. It has to cool for 30 minutes. And then I would mix it in a Dr. Brown's pitcher and put in the amount of scoops of formula that it needs.

Many people think that we are sterilizing the water when we boil the water, but it's truly for the formula and your formula canes will tell you to do this. So if you want to go the route of using tap water, you just want to make sure that the water in your area that you're in, the city that you're in is safe. I personally would still boil the water if you have well water. However, now that my baby is older, boiling the water just takes so much time and effort. So now we just use bottled water. And if you look it up, a lot of people do recommend using bottled water and they say that it's one of the safer options. But the most safe option is refrigerated filtered water. As long as you keep your filter up to date and it is clean. I just like how easy it is when we are on the go to use bottled water.

I just pumped and I also just used the last of the ready made bottles that I had. So I need to bottle more breast milk for Lordy. And maybe in a couple minutes he will work with me a little and let me put him down because that has not been happening. This morning. I knew that I was going to be drinking last night. I had a couple drinks with Bailey's, like Bailey's Irish cream. And so I pulled these two bags of breast milk out of the freezer to thaw because obviously I can't feed him like Bailey's milk.

I figured the best way to go about this was to reserve a meeting room at my office. Somehow I got the one that actually didn't have a door that closed the entire time. I'm freaking out, wondering if someone's going to accidentally come in. Thankfully, my job is really flexible and I have the ability to walk away and do this because I know that so many women don't. This room did have a web camera though, so I hit it with this disinfectant. Someone happened to leave their backpack in here and came in to get it while I was mid pump, which was kind of awkward, but I was covered, so he didn't say anything. But it was still like kind of weird. A lot of mixed feelings about going back to work. But honestly, at the end of the day, I know that I'm incredibly privileged to be in the situation that I'm in right now. We all seen the images and videos. Displaced Palestinians who have lost a lot of loved ones. I get to go home after this eight hour shift and hug my baby. There are mothers out there who are grieving the loss of their newborn babies and this is probably a drop in the bucket. I plan on matching any sort of income that I make from this one minute video and donating to a family in need that desperately needs it more than me. Being a part of the TikTok creator program definitely has its perks, but it would be such a waste if I actually didn't use the money that I generate to someone who needs it more than me. So no.

And like pretty much everything you use, they can't like reuse it like the binkies. And it's like a package of diapers was already open, which there was a lot. So I got to take a lot of diapers home.

I don't do the time with your date and how much I like Parent choice bag or Medela. The Lanceno bags leak so I don't really use those. And then you just get all the air out. Push the milk up to the top and store them flat and you can do this for all your milk. You can pull it for 24 hours and then you don't have to keep them in these and you don't lose any fat.

What method do you use? #kendamilformula #formulapreperation #babybottles #sterilisingbottles,"Here is how to sterilise the bottles with the cold water method. Always wash your hands before handling the bottles and then clean the bottles and the teats in soapy water as soon as possible. After feeds, use a clean dedicated bottle brush to clean the bottles and a small teat brush to clean the inside of the teats. You can also turn the teats inside out to wash them. Once washed, rinse everything in cold water to remove the soap before sterilising. Grab your cold water steriliser, fill with cold water and add your sterilizing tablet. Your steriliser should have a plunger to keep all of the equipment under the solution and always change the sterilising solution every 24 hours. The bottles should be left in the solution for at least 30 minutes to sterilise. It's best to leave your bottles in the steriliser until needed but if you do take them out, wash your hands. Put the bottle together straight away on a clean surface or on the upturned lid of the steriliser.","Keeping your bottles clean and sterile 🍼 💦 Cold Water sterilising is one of the oldest methods around and still one of the most simple & convenient.

So the idea is that you stick the pump parts into the refrigerator in between sessions to slow the growth of bacteria. This is an optional step, but you can clean the inside of the flange. As you see here. I tilt the bottle, spray it once or twice, take a clean paper towel, and wipe it down. I do this so that I can see my milk spring at the start of the session. Take take a clean Ziploc bag and stick your pump parts in. Then you're going to go ahead and get all the air out and zip it all up.

Bub just isn't thriving. He isn't getting enough. It's just not, not doing him any good. He only put on 80 grams in four days, which he should be putting on at least 60 grams a day. There's my milk collection that I forgot to show you in the last video. But we just decided to stop anyways. I cleaned up the kitchen, I did the washing. This is yesterday before I decided to stop. This is my midday pump. And then I started cooking dinner. And this is where I did make the decision that we are just going to start putting him on the breast. He obviously is still going to be getting the breast milk that I have exposed breast, but other than that, he's not hopping on the breast anymore. It's upsetting, but it's more upsetting to have a sick baby. So we started prepping all these bottles ready for him to start bottle feeding. And then we started doing, filling up his, doing the milk. So throughout two days, I got 300 mils like normal. These bags are. I paid $10 for 20 bags and they are the flimsiest, weakest little things ever. Never again. I'm sticking with Kmart bags next time. Anyways, I got six bags of 50 mils from my two days of pumping. And then last night, because I didn't do any afternoon feeds or night feeds, I got 100 meals, 50 meals from each breast. So I got another two bags. So I got eight bags all up. He did have some breasts last night, early morning, and then a bottle. But you know, that's just our extra bonding time we get before it's completely gone. But I woke up this morning and did my morning pump because girl don't want mastitis. And I got another 100 meals from both boobs, like 50 each. So that's telling me that he was only getting roughly 50 mils, if not maybe 70 tops, which isn't good. He should be on 95 mils to 120 mils. Anyways, we're just glad that we can monitor how much he's putting in. I want healthy babies, not sick babies. Anyways, a little bit of a sad moment because we won't be bagging milk up for too much longer. This was my morning pump and then I just did my second pump for the day. Realized after that it wasn't actually pumping on this breast yet. That was a nipple slip. Don't take it down TikTok. It's sexist. So I just put the pump back on the other side because I didn't set it up properly, obviously. No, my kids are not dying, and I got about 40 mils from that one.","#mumof3 #irishtwins #2under1 #fyp #mumsoftiktok #mumtok #mumlife #mumtiktoker #brisbane #csection #fypシ #milkstorage #breastpump #fyp #foryou Sadly, we are ending our breastfeeding journey.

Here's my little disclaimer. This works for me, this works for my schedule, and this works for my baby. So if it works for you, great. If not, I'm so sorry. Continue doing what you're doing because you're doing a great job. But I live in a two story, so I refuse to come up and down stairs in the middle of the night or for the first time. So what I do is I actually have three sets of pump parts and I wash and sterilize them while we're at dinner. Then I put them in a Ziploc bag when we go upstairs for the night. And that's what I use for my nighttime pump, my three 4am pump, and then my first morning pump. After I get done pumping, I do combine as much as I can into one bottle in hopes that it fits into one bottle. If not, I just use both of them, put the lids on them, and put them in the fridge. And as for the pump parts, I run water through them to get as much milk out as I can and then put them in my bin for the rest of the night until I come downstairs in the. When I come downstairs in the morning, I make sure to do a thorough wash through of all of my pump parts. So I of course take everything apart. I make sure to get all the way in here, scrub it with every tiny brush to make sure that they're thoroughly clean, and then put them in my sterilize. I like to make sure that I get all of these in the sterilizer at one time, which I can fit all of these in the six bottles. It's been a little bit of a Tetris mission, but I figured it out. So then when it's done running, I actually can leave them in there during the day so they stay in a nice sterilized environment. Because I also use this hack during the day. So I'll pump, pull everything out of the sterilizer that I need at that time pump, and then I put it in my washing bin that sits next to my sink. And then once I use all three parts, then I wash everything all together. This helps me throughout the day not have to keep running my sterilizer. I don't have to keep washing bottles every three hours. I don't have to keep washing parts every three hours. So for me, this is a huge time saver. I just want to reiterate that after I'm done pumping, I do make sure I run these through water just to get as much milk out as I can before I just store them in here overnight. And then even during the day, I make sure to get out as much as I can and then wash them all together and sterilize them all together. But let me know if you have any questions.","My pump part hack!

People, listen up. Gotten lots and lots of questions on if you should chill your freshly expressed milk before adding it to your pitcher. According to the cdc, you should. So when you freshly express breast milk, it's relatively warm, and if you add it to your chilled milk that's already in the pitcher, you run the risk of kind of heating that milk up and allowing bacteria to grow. So here's what I do when I'm adding milk to my pitcher. When I have a freshly expressed bottle like this, I go ahead and I just put a lid on it and I put it in the fridge right next to my pitcher. This is milk that has already chilled down to the temperature of the milk in my pitcher. So I'm going to go ahead and add that to my pitcher. Now, the fat tends to separate, so you can kind of see it's like at the top of the bottle. So I take my warm hands and I roll the milk like this so that the fat gets incorporated back into the milk so that when I add it to my pitcher, I'm not losing all of that fat. So I roll it and roll it and roll it until it's looking good. It's okay to swirl milk. I wouldn't recommend shaking it because it can add a lot of air bubbles. There was a theory that that decreases the nutrients, but I don't think that's true. But it does add air bubbles, so I tend to swirl instead of shake. Then I just pop this milk in my pitcher again. This is the milk that is already chilled to the temperature of the milk that is in the pitcher. So it's okay to add it. Pop my pitcher back in the fridge. And then once that fresh expressed milk that I put in there is chilled down room temperature, or, sorry, chilled down to fridge temperature, I will add it to my pitcher. There was a comment I saw that said that you could add expressed milk, freshly expressed milk that was warm to a pitcher as long as there was more chilled milk in the pitcher than there was warm milk that you were adding. So if you're in a pinch and you don't feel like chilling the milk before the pitcher, that's probably the rule that I would follow. But otherwise, if you have time, just make sure you chill the milk before you add it to your pitcher and you don't run the risk of any bacteria getting introduced.","You should try to avoid combining different temps of milk when using the pitcher method - how I chill milk before adding to my pitcher! #milkstorage #pumpingmomsoftiktok #pumpingjourney #breastfeedingjourney #breastfeedingtips #pumpingtips #pitchermethod #milkpitcher #exclusivelypumping #exclusivepumping  My pumping pitcher method.

Pumping and breastfeeding in general is probably one of the hardest things your body has to do postpartum, which is why I feel like choosing the right pump is super important. Lano's wearable pumps has definitely been a game changer for me. Plus I can even pump on the way to work, which is just amazing. If you're looking for the perfect pump for your pumping journey, you guys should definitely check out Lano's wearable pumps."

I thought I would just come on here and show the process of how I bag my daughter's milk. So what I do is I will collect all the milk from 7am to midnight into this jug. And then in the morning of the next day, I will make her bottles from this milk. So I'll make four bottles that kind of will feed her throughout the day. And then I'll grab. Grab milk from the freezer stash and let that defrost for her nighttime bottles. So then this is all the milk that I'm left with and then I will freeze it that day. So I know some people wait like three or four days before they freeze it all, but I just will freeze it the next day. That way there's not so much collecting that, you know, you end up having freeze bags and bags of milk. So I usually estimate that this will be like four or five bags. And I freeze in five ounces. So just kind of mix it up a little. And I always measure into the bottles or some form of measuring cup just because the bags are not that accurate. And then show you how I, like close the bag to get rid of all the air bubbles. I watched people do this and I, like struggled so much with it until I kind of figured out my own way. So you close almost right towards the end. Just leave a little bit so that air can come out. And then you just squeeze all the milk up until you are literally left with no space. And then you close it. And then I love these bags because they freeze really flat. And then what I do is I just get a loaf pan and I lay them flat in there. I'll show you when it's all done. And then I throw this in the freezer and then they freeze really flat. So I'm going to continue bottling all of this. And I also write how many ounces and the date on the bag just so I know it can stay in the freezer for six months. But I mean, I know my milk's not going to be in the freezer that long, so I'm not too worried. But still good to date. Just so you're rotating through your stash properly. But yeah, I tried the method where you just like fold it and then try to get the air bubbles out. Like you kind of like fold like this and then do that. And it just. The. The bags never stayed flat. I also feel like it depends on the bags you use. Like the. I had a hard time with the Medella bags and like the Lancino bags, they just. I didn't like the shape of them. These bags, and the Target brand I really like, because they're just, like, perfect rectangles, and they freeze really flat. So, yeah, we're left with a little bit. I'm not going to bag this. I'm just gonna start collecting today's milk and putting it in here. And then usually after, like, three days, I'll do a full empty and then, like, clean it out just so that, you know, there's no, like, bacteria or old milk. Just stack them up alternate ways that way, and then it's all flat. And then that'll go in the freezer, and then tomorrow morning, they'll all be frozen solid, and then I'll move them into the deep freezer. Yeah. I hope that was helpful.","Bag some milk with me. #oversupplymom #oversupplier #exclusivepumping #milkstorage #milkstoragetips #milkbags #milkbagging #milkbrick #milkbricks #freezerstash  Good morning.

This is called the Quick Clean Breast Pump and accessory Sanitizer. I spray all my pump parts down with this. I also use the Dabble Baby breast pump cleansing wipes. I got the new portable ones which make it so easy to pack when you're on the go, and it doesn't take up any. Any space. So first things first. So this is what I'm going to use. All these are on my Amazon storefront if y'all interested. But first, when I don't have water, I always disassemble my pump parts, and I literally wipe out the milk residue. So I use clean Kleenex or paper towel, whatever I have available, and I wipe out the milk residue. Okay? So I'm going to wipe all these down, get it all out, and I'll tell you what step two is.

So y'all wipe that thing down. Okay, y'all? So everything is completely wiped. Next thing I do is my sanitizing spray, and I spray all over each pump. Part two, of course, sanitize it. Now, this is just what works. Works for me, y'all. Oh. Sprayed myself. I am not telling y'all to do it, but this is what I do when I don't have any water available, and I feel pretty okay with this method. And I feel like my pump parts are actually clean. So spray it inside of everything, outside of everything. So, yeah. And then y'all, I let that air dry. If I don't have time to let it air dry, I use a paper towel. I use a paper towel and dry them.

Let's make bottles for the day so that I can empty this out and then clean it and start putting everything I've pumped today into this jar because this is all yesterday's milk. Still. I'm making enough for eight bottles total. Eight of these little Phillips bottles. I do 80 milliliters each into every bottle and then I'm going to do 240 into here because I only have five bottles clean right this minute. It is poop Thursday today, but it is very rainy outside so I'm not sure he is going to come. The dogs don't even notice. Honestly. They were asleep in our bedroom like with the door shut and I thought their poop friend was here and I didn't want them to wake my husband up. So I let them out of the room and got them all hype thinking it was poop Thursday. But it wasn't him at all. It was. I had ordered a bag of dog food to be delivered to the house. It was the dog food delivery, not the poop guy. So whoops, sorry guys. Instead I had to give them a treat because now I got them all excited thinking their friend was here. But who knows, he might still come. He might make an appearance. I can never remember if he comes when it rains.

Let's make bottles for the day so that I can empty this out and then clean it and start putting everything I've pumped today into this jar because this is all yesterday's milk. Still. I'm making enough for eight bottles total. Eight of these little Phillips bottles. I do 80 milliliters each into every bottle and then I'm going to do 240 into here because I only have five bottles clean right this minute. It is poop Thursday today, but it is very rainy outside so I'm not sure he is going to come. The dogs don't even notice. Honestly. They were asleep in our bedroom like with the door shut and I thought their poop friend was here and I didn't want them to wake my husband up. So I let them out of the room and got them all hype thinking it was poop Thursday. But it wasn't him at all. It was. I had ordered a bag of dog food to be delivered to the house. It was the dog food delivery, not the poop guy. So whoops, sorry guys. Instead I had to give them a treat because now I got them all excited thinking their friend was here. But who knows, he might still come. He might make an appearance. I can never remember if he comes when it rains.

Many of you have commented on how crazy my milk supply is and I do pump a lot. But here's the thing. I'm starting to struggle to keep up with these triplets. Every time they eat, it takes nine and a half ounces just to feed all three of them. Yesterday I pumped 76 ounces for reference, and I was having to make bottles after every single pump just to keep up. I did have a really good pump this morning though. I pumped 32 ounces. So I was able to make enough bottles to get us through the 4:00 feed today. I've been looking up ways though, to increase my milk supply just to see see if I can make any more. And a lot of you have recommended body armor drinks. I was cracking up. Last night I told my husband I need to get some body armor and he said, what do you think you are, a knight? What do you want some. A bulletproof vest? I mean, I guess I needed to specify, but it's funny. Anyway, we like to use color coordination to keep things simple. The girls drank out of the pink, blue and purple bottles. Teddy's bottles are all clear. On my last video, I talked about my warmers that stay on for 24 hours.

Let's talk about the basics of storing breast milk. Firstly, when you store breast milk in the fridge, they say it is safe for four days. Some say six days. And when you store in a freezer, it's good up to six months. In a deep freezer, it's good up to six months and preferably up to a year. So I write the date that I store the milk in each storage bag and the mills that I'm gonna put inside the storage bags. One thing that you need to know is that the meals that are written on the storage bag are not accurate. So every time, you must always measure using a bottle and put inside so that you will be very sure how much milk you have stored in each bag. This is how I remove the air inside the storage bag. The purpose is to allow the storage bag to lay flat. So when you put in the fridge, they become so flat that they create more. They create more space for you to actually put more breast storage bags inside them. So there are many ways that you can use to remove the air inside. And I've shown you the first one. This is the other one that you can use to remove the air, whichever one works for you. And make sure that you seal the plastic storage bag very tightly. Because if you don't seal it tightly, you will find that your milk has spilled over. This is how it should look in your freezer. Follow me for more tips. Bye.","This is howni store my breast milk.you can put milk in the fridge for 4-6 days but i make sure i dont go until 4days without bagging,in the freezer for 6months in the deep freezer for 6-12months but ill go for 6months.i hope this helps#breastfeedingworkingmom #breastfeeedingtips #lactation #breastmilk #powerpumpingmama #20weekspostpartum #pumpsessions #milksupplytips #pitchermethod #exclusivepumping  Hello, mummies.

After three months as long as it isn't well water it is safe to use bottled water for three months. You will have to boil the water to sterilize the formula. Get a big scoop and level off the top with a lid or something flat. Also make sure your hands are washed before you do this. I'm using the US measurements 4oz eye level to 2 scoops. I'm adding my nipple. Honestly whatever size nipple it just depends on the baby. Then I shake and then after shaking I'll add the vent in and this is like to prevent colic or something I don't know but yeah we're done here. If you want to heat up the bottle do not use the microwave. You can use a bowl of hot water and just put the bottle in it.

Depending on the temperature of your house, the temperature of your fridge or freezer, whether using deep freezer is going to change, but this is going to be the safest way. Just remember five five hours at room temperature, five days in the fridge and five months in the freezer. Deep freezers can be good up to a year. You want to make sure you store your milk in smaller increments. Do not fill the bag full. You're going to waste a lot more milk that way. In the early days, I recommend freezing milk in 2 to 3 ounce increments. When they start getting a little older, you could do three to four oun increments, but you can always thaw out more milk. But you can't refreeze already thawed milk. Once milk is thawed, it needs to be used within 24 hours. Also make sure that you measure the milk in a bottle before you put it in the bag. The measurements on the bags are not accurate. Make sure you're labeling your night milk versus your day milk so that night milk is fed to baby at night and day milk is fed during the day. You can write the time down or you can just write night on the night milk. If you have any questions about milk storage or any other breastfeeding questions, please let me know.

Take a shot. Okay, so I went to Walmart and I went shopping for my baby, and they have the cutest clothes and it's fun to buy everything. But I'm just gonna show you what I got. Also, is anybody else's baby growing at rapid speed? Because I feel like I'm constantly buying my baby clothes and he's growing. Like, I got him this little set, super cute, like a little matching pants to go with it. And then I got him a pair of socks because he always needs socks. And I feel like they're getting lost every. Everywhere. When I wash the socks, I put them, like in a little mesh bag so I don't lose them. And I still lose them, so that's that. I also got him these little onesies because these are so comfortable for him just to sleep in. Look at these. How freaking cute. How cute is that? I got gray. Look at these.

So this is like we go through a total of 11 to 12 bottles in a 24 hour period. And this is how I store it. I pretty much have the milk made in here, put it into the bottles, put the bottles into the fridge and then make a little bit more in here just in case I warm up a bottle and it needs a little bit of cool milk in it to cool it down. Or if he gets hungry and immediately wants another ounce, I could just pour some of this in there and heat it up without grabbing a whole nother bottle and then having to basically waste it because he won't eat the rest. And you have a limited amount of time with his bacteria in there and the fact that it's already been out of the fridge to like, you know, have him drink the rest of it and yeah, so breast milk wise I only make about, this is like 2 ounces, but I only make about 4 ounces total for the whole day. So this whole thing filled up is the most I can make in a day. I have a very low flow here, so. But what I find is helpful is instead of putting it in this because I have a low supply and I look at it like, you know, the milk's all the way down here and I'm like, wow, I really feel like I'm not doing much, you know, makes you feel sad. And instead of putting it in here, which is still like, you know, come on, am I actually gonna fill this up? When am I gonna fill this up? We'll see. What I do is I take one of these bottles and I fill it up in here and I save it. I label it as booby milk and I save it because what happens is psychologically I'm looking at it like I'm building up a bottle that looks like the equivalent to one of his normal bottles and one of his normal amount of ounces that he gets in a bottle. So I'm like, oh, I made a whole bottle and I feel more accomplished. I feel better about it instead of just feeling like I, I'm slowly building up one of these and definitely not having anything produced in one of these. So. So yeah, anyway, that's where we're at on our milk, our milk journey. And we're only doing the Dr. Brown's bottles because we found that works the best. And we're doing premium nipples for a very slow flow because he chokes and we're doing sensitive milk because he's been throwing up everything else. So, yeah, Milk Journey.

I started the pitcher method a couple days ago and I'm liking it so far. I need to order some, like, the pour lids for my jars, but yeah, so this is my first pump of the day. It's like 10am now, but I probably pumped like 9, 9:30, so. And I had a nurse like an hour or two before that. So my right boob got a little over four and then my left boob got a little under three. Like probably 2.7. I like, I always nurse on my right because I don't really know why, to be honest. I think I hear my cat crying outside. Come in. Hold on. So I am considering breastfeeding more often or and eventually not pumping at all just because it is very time consuming. It's time that I miss out cuddling with my baby or just getting other stuff done. The main reason why I pumped in the beginning was because my baby was a preemie baby and she wouldn't latch or stay awake long enough to get full feedings. I think I said this before, but, like, that's what kept us in the hospital for the most part is she just didn't stay. She was too sleepy to stay awake to eat long enough. And she did better with bottles. And so, you know, I obviously just wanted her to be able to eat on her own. I didn't really care whether it was a bottle or breast. So one of the nurses in the hospital suggests that I try a nipple shield. And it helped a lot. She latched like, so much better and was getting full feedings in on the breast. So we did that for a long time, even after we got home. And I kept trying to nurse without it, but she just, she was getting angry and she wouldn't do it. So up until like a couple, like a week or two ago, I had to use the shield. All right. My phone just went black and I have no idea what I was talking about when it did. But yeah, she. Up until a week or so ago, she used a shield. So it was just a pain in the ass. And that's a big reason why I pumped most of the time was because I hated using the shield.

This is what works for us. So I always have two rows of bottles here. I have one row of grow bottles and one row of boy bottles. I just put them. Normally I make them all together so I just put them in the row. But if I were to make some more bottles like right now, I would just put them in behind it so that I know that we're still using the bottles that were first made at the front. So this is how I store the actual milk. So I have four of these 1 liter glass jars in this row. I always have today's pumped milk. So this is this morning's pumped milk. So I always just put this to the back and then as I fill more bottles I'll put them in front and then at the end of the day I will pull all of the milk forward here. So I would just make all of the bottles from these and then whatever I don't use goes in front. So I know that that's the oldest milk. And then I normally just tuck this last glass bottle in behind this row and that's sort of how I keep track and make sure that I don't mess up what milk is the oldest milk. And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump.","Replying to @BeautyQueen hopefully this makes sense!

And that way I can always just pull from the front and then it's not confusing for my husband either. He always knows. We've used the same system for quite a few months now since I bought these glass bottles. But. But it basically means that I can have 4 liters of milk in the fridge and I haven't made any bottles from yesterday's milk. So that's why I have so much in the fridge right now. But I will use like this front stuff first. And basically once I have a full extra jar of milk is normally whenever I start to freeze stuff and that's what I do to keep track. Normally this is more full with a bunch of bottles, but not everything was clean last night. So those are clean now. I'm going to make bottles shortly and then the fridge will be full again. I'll wash all of these glass bottles after I empty them and then just start filling them with my next pump."

Hope this helps you and if it’s not what you need, no worries scroll on by!  I never thought in a million years, I’d ever make a video on how to wash plastic bottles, but here we are!! You’ve requested it, so hope it helps!!  I use a dedicated washing up bowl for JUST bottles! I like the collapsible ones because they save on space!! I also like to use a bottle cleanser as it’s gentler than fairy liquid! We use the @nukbabyuk one as recommended by my friend Soph!  I wash each piece throughly in the hot soapy water and then rinse under cool water until they squeaky clean! You can audibly hear the squeak, then you know there’s no milk residue on them! Powdered formula is especially sticky! However it applies for breast milk that’s been expressed and pre made formula!  Then I sterilize them all! I know @mambaby_uk bottles are self sterilizing in the microwave, BUT, it was like Moby Dick had had a bath in my kitchen everytime I did them this way! I was so sick of water everywhere!  We were kindly sent the UV sterilizer and dryer from @vitalbabyuk and it’s a game changer! I think it’s fantastic!!  Pop a pair of tongs in so you don’t have to touch any pieces of the bottle that’ll be “inside” and then you can put them together knowing they are as sterile as possible!!  Give your bowl and brush a clean to make sure there’s no milk residue in/on them using the cleanser and TADA!  It’s super simple and easy, many people may will think this is overkill, but this is how we were taught as best practice and something I wanted to do for Harry too!  If you’ve got a way you prefer and that works for you, that’s great! No pressure here, just showing you how I do mine for anyone who’d like it!  There isn’t much out there on bottles and formula and it can be a bit daunting!!  Hope it helps at least one of you!!!  Ps.

There's also this little thing that pops completely off that I can set my pump parts on. Like if I wash them and they're drying or I just don't want to put them on a dirty space or whatever because who knows? Especially with me working at the hospital, like, I really just don't want my pump parts touching things. And then the inside is a wet to dry bag so you can flip it out and wash it out. But this is really convenient because once my pump parts are clean and ready to go, and this is clean, I just throw them in for the night. And then after I use them, I can throw them in here and then I can just throw this whole bag in into the refrigerator until I pump again. I'm not really pumping a whole ton now and I went down to one pump a night. Like I don't know when, but I still love this. This has gotten so much use.

So the fridge hack is when you take your pump parts and your bottle parts and instead of cleaning them after you use them, you put them in the refrigerator till the next time you have to use them again. While it seems like it could possibly be safe, the temperature of the fridge is not at a stable enough temperature to kill the bacteria that can live in those parts and pie, including but not limited to yeast, and it can cause thrush in you and the baby if you're pumping and that it can get tricky to be rid of. TikTok is great for learning things, but really, before you start a hack like this, you really need to do your research and do your due diligence to find out if it's worth the risk to use the hack.","Replying to @welfarewilma I did this and got thrush.  .

How easy would you say it is cleaning the baby bottles? Let me tell you. So first of all, backing up. We use this brand for all of our baby bottles and breast pumps. We breastfeed, although we did use formula in the first month or so because our son had a tongue tie. So the brand here is called Medela. I'd never heard of them before we had a kid. Now I can't stop seeing them. And we've got all of their products, pretty much everything you need for breastfeeding. They're really, really good. I can't recommend them enough. Grab yourself these bo. But there is nothing you can do about the breast milk residue. It is real. So you want to run your tap really, really hot. You want to do a couple of splashes out, cleaning the bottle, the nozzle and the little cap that puts on the nozzle to the bottle. And then you want to get yourself this again. It's Medella coming out of nowhere and then suddenly the biggest partner in crime in your life, out of nowhere. Now they're here. Out of nowhere. Now they're here. Give it a pump or two. I probably over pump it. I let that sit for like 10, 20 seconds and then I rinse it out. It get, rinse that, rinse that out. But at that stage, you know the bottle's not sterilized and if you leave it, it's going to take ages to dry or you're gonna have to hand dry it and the smears are probably still going to be there. So this, honestly guys, it's, it's, it's an investment. It's hefty. It's 109, $99. But get the baby brezza because once you're done with that first step, stick it in there and then you can fit a lot in here. It's very compact. It looks like you can't fit a lot, but you definitely can. So throw everything in there. It also, you can include and any sort of, any bottles for that store milk and also any kind of breast pump equipment. Throw it in there. It's got like a 45 minute timer. It cleans it thoroughly, it sterilizes it and then it dries it. Little beeps to let you know it's starting and done. And then Bob's your uncle, pop it out and away you go. All of these things are on my Amazon storefront. There's a link in the bio. We put together a newborn starter pack for everything that if we had to hit the rewind button and come back with our baby boy from the hospital. Today are the things that we wish we came home to. It's a survival guide. And what you're really buying here is not a fancy cleaning piece of equipment. You are buying yourself time. That was the Staten island ferry. And you're going to need a lot of time. You're going to need all the time you can get when you're a parent. Hit me up with any questions. Thanks.

I'm back with some things you may not know about breastfeeding. So first of all, breastfeeding is not free. I don't care how many people tell you it is. It's not. Make sure you separate your morning milk from your nighttime milk because your nighttime milk has melatonin in it to help baby sleep. Make sure you never combine your milk unless it's at the same temperature before you combine it. If baby doesn't finish a bottle, the leftover breast milk can be used within two hours, and after that it must be thrown away. Mothers who breastfeed have a low risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Breastfeeding burns anywhere between 500 and 600 calories, but you probably gonna eat that back because it also makes you extra hungry. You can drink, but in moderation. It is possible that breastfeeding can cause vaginal dryness, but not me, though. And be prepared that if you become an oversupplier, you'll need to have several freezers and deep freezers to store your breast milk. I hope this helps.","Here’s a few things you may or may not know about breastfeeding.

Here’s everything ive learned. #pitchermethod #pumpingmom #handsfreepumping #breastfeeding #pumping #newmom #pregnanttiktok #babytok #milkstorage #milkstoragetips ,"When I was pregnant and when I was getting ready to start pumping, I had so many questions about the pitcher method and milk storage. I read so many things to try and like, gather all the information. So I'm gonna try and put everything that I learned in one video. Okay, you do the pitcher method. Because every time you pump, your milk is a little bit different. Sometimes it's really fatty, sometimes it's really watery. Sometimes different boobs are different. Sometimes different times of day. This is what I do. So I start a pitcher and I can keep the pitcher going for four days because that's as long as you can keep milk in the fridge. So when I start the pitcher with my first day, I go ahead and get a milk bag and I put the date on the milk bag and I put. Whether it was in the a.m. or the p.m. you think you're going to remember, you will not remember. So I go ahead and make this milk bag and then I put it under the picture and I just like, that's how I remember. I pump at night. So here's my pump from last night. This is from both sides. I like consolidated it into one. And I'm just going to dump it in and then I pump in the mornings with my hands free. Mom cozy V1s. So I'm going to add these in. These are all the same temperature, so they've all been same sitting in the fridge. Now, if I have one piece of advice. If you're gonna pump, you should get one of those skin care fridges and leave it up in your room so that you can either put pumped milk into it or my husband does the bottle in the morning, so he gets a bottle out of that fridge and we have the bottle warmer up there too. Okay, I hope this all fits. Now I'm gonna make my bottles out of this. All this milk that's consolidated with all of the fat and all of the watery milk and everything from the last few days. And I'm gonna mix it up and that's how I'm going to pour the bottles. So tonight she'll have. She does 6 ounces at night and then she does 4 ounces in the morning. And I can go all the way up until 1 5pm and then everything that's left after I pump and make the bottles after those four days, I will freeze. One thing to keep in mind is that when you do the pitcher method, all, all the milk becomes as old as the oldest milk in the pitcher, obviously, because you're mixing it together. All of the bags that I freeze from this pitcher are going to read one one I always pump more than she drinks in a bottle, so I always have some to freeze. But even if you don't end up with any to freeze, the pitcher method is still a really good one because it gives those even bottles every time. I feel like there's so much like piecemeal information about the pitcher method, so that's everything that I gathered through my journey towards breastfeeding and the pitcher method and bottles and all that. So I hope it's helpful for someone or anyone. Happy pumping.","Milk storage is confusing.

And this is something I'm not seeing on Tick Tock. So my supply totally tanked. Reason being is that that pump or that breastfeed in the night is so crucially important and it made everything completely tank. So for like reference, my slacker, I was literally making 0.25 ounces. And that is with self expressing, literally getting every drop out. I'm not even kidding. You basically was like dried up, sis. Okay. And then my other one, I was making 2 ounces at most, most of the time an ounce and a half. So on a really good pump, I would get like two and a half ounces, sometimes three, like on like the morning pump. So with that being said, I was freaking out and I started doing some research. Tik Tok kept spewing the same, literally your body armor, your water, your coconut water, all of those things which I did do, but I was doing those things prior also. So I'm going to share with you guys what I know helped my supply increase tremendously. I went from making probably 20 ounces a day, if that because I wasn't even making enough to feed my daughter. Thank God for my best friend and my sister, otherwise I would have had to get formula. So I wasn't even making enough to feed my daughter. She drinks 3 ounces. Just like freaking out. Anyways, I always do the slacker first because I feel like I just, just have to. What I did was, you know, you see how you drink coconut water? Coconut water, coconut water, coconut water. Well, I read coconut oil. Coconut oil. Okay. Body armors. It's like how many of those can I chug? And I was drinking them anyways and like my supply was still like not the best. So what I did was I was taking a tablespoon of coconut oil. And when I tell you this literally made my supply more than double. More than double. I'm not even kidding you. And I don't know why this is not on Tick Tock. I'm shocked because I've seen everything else and it's all like the same being said. So this is like the smaller end of like what I've been pumping. We got another 5 ounces. So we now have 13 ounces in total. And that is not counting. So her feedings are aside from that 25 ounces already today when prior I was making 20 ounces a day. So get on the coconut oil. A tablespoon of coconut oil a day. It's going to clean you out, but you want to be cleaned out anyways, okay?

Just because I normally make everything just sit down and then have to get back up and empty it. So I decided to unload and load the dishwasher. There were a couple things that needed to be hand washed, so I went ahead and took care of that. Wipe down all the counters, and then I already had to empty my pump, so I just finished up, tidying, cleaning up the sink, and then I went ahead and made my breakfast. Obviously just had some cereal and coffee today, so I went and enjoyed my breakfast and now my kitchen's clean, so I don't have to worry about that for the rest of the day."

I started off by gathering all of the milk out of the fridge, and this is when I figured I needed to freeze the milk as well. The only milk that I left in the fridge was the milk that I pumped today because I'll use that for my bottle making for tomorrow. So I got all of the milk mixed up and I just started pouring into the bottles here. My twins are now 10 months old, which is crazy to think about. So they're doing about five bottles a day and they seem to be shifting how much they're wanting to eat at a time. So sometimes they will eat their full bottle and want a little bit more and I'm just rolling with what they want to do. So they're doing five bottles, one is 200 mils and all of the rest of them are 160 mils. After I got all of those bottles made and put away, I just grabbed all of the milk that was left over, made sure it was all mixed up really well, divided out into 100mil quantities, and poured it into the pre labeled bags and I ended up having a little bit more milk than I anticipated. I'm not really sure what happened last week. I guess just because they're not drinking as much, I had a lot more to freeze. So I ended up with 1,700mils or 17 bags of milk to put away. I just went ahead and laid them flat in my fridge freezer, grabbed all of the frozen milk that I froze last week and made a brick out of that, labeled it out and brought it up to my deep freeze. So I just added this brick onto my total and tossed into the deep freeze and I was done.","#pumping #momsoftiktok #mom #momtok #baby #sahmlife #SAHM #momlife #twins #exclusivepumper #twinmom #breastmilk #exclusivepumping #oversupplier #oversupplymom #pitchermethod #bottlefed #freezerstash #freezingmilk #milktok #milksupply #milkstorage #elvie #elviestridepump #elviestride  Here's a quick little bottle prep and a freezer stash update.

I am so happy that the fridge hack helped so many of you. It's crazy when I learned it how much of a game changer it was for me, especially with pumping. But I did want to address this comment really quick because it was the first one of the biggest things that I learned within the first like two months as a mom, I joined like all of these Facebook mom groups. Just thinking like, I'm gonna educate myself on all of these things. I'm a first time mom, new mom. Just had tons of questions and what I'm going to tell you is if the Facebook mom group is doing a disservice to your mental health and not actually helping, like you went there for a reason and you're actually feeling more anxiety and less than or judged. Leave the Facebook mom group. Just leave it. Don't get me wrong, there's a few that I'm still a part of that I can just maneuver through, find the information that I need. But there was more than a few that I actually left because they were. It was just, I just felt judged. Again, less than. And it wasn't helping me, it was just adding to my stress. You're feeling that way, leave it. And ask your pediatrician, your doctor if you have like specific questions. But I did get questions on the bag that I use. So this is the Medela Quick Clean and you can get them on Amazon. It's actually a way that you can like disinfect your pump parts as well. You actually stick your pump parts in. What it's used for or what it's intended for is sticking your pump parts in and putting them in the microwave, which is like a steaming way to disinfect them. I want to say this bag is good for 12 uses. 20, 20 uses per bag. So honestly, I've personally never used it for its intended purpose to go in the microwave. But they are super convenient if you are again on a time crunch or need to quickly disinfect your pump parts at work. But I do use this to put my pump parts in in the fridge. And then somebody asked if you need a clean bag each use. And it's not each use. So it's not after every pump throughout the day, but it's every day. So you do, you should be using a clean bag every day. I will say use your discernment. There's a couple comments about you shouldn't be using this and bacteria and all of that, which obviously I knew that those were going to come. But use your discernment, your judgment. If it's if you feel comfortable using it, this method, go for it. If you don't, don't. That's all I'm gonna say there. I've personally never had a problem and it works great. Especially again, pumping throughout the day and not having to clean your parts every two to three hours. Like I was taking 20 to 30 minutes. No, not 30 minutes. Probably like 20 minutes just to clean everything and then dry everything because everything has to be so dry to be able to use it again. So anyways, the fridge hack worked great for me.","Reply to @thekdubs  Frige Hack is a game changer! #breastfeedingmom #pumpingmama #milkmama #firstimemom #pumpinghack #fridgehack #momtok Good morning.

So as Eli's wake windows were getting longer and longer, I was getting more and more confused. So we downloaded the Huckleberry app and we started tracking his sleep and whatnot inside of the app. But they have this amazing feature called Sweet Spot that basically will predict when your child should have naps and when they should have their wake windows, how long their wake windows should be. And by following that, we are literally getting like six hour stretches of sleep at night. Oh my gosh. When I'm inside of the app, I can log everything right here and if I just click on Sweet Spot here at the top and click the calendar, it's going to show me his predicted sleep schedule for the day, which has been so helpful and extremely accurate.

I can't take both of them out because for some reason they spill. I'll put them in these. This is about 7 ounces of milk. Hopefully it doesn't spill out. That's what we're hoping for.

I think I could fit it. This has six ounces. That's one. I think I'm like an over producer. So my last babies, I wasn't able to produce a lot of milk by pumping. And I'm gonna be honest with you guys. I think that if you're stressed or if you're like, in a relationship that you're not happy in or something that has a lot to do with your milk supply. Because Puda Puda's like baby life. I could not produce this much milk. Like, I could give it to him from here, but I was not able to pump out a lot of milk for him, so. And I'm starting to think that it had to do with, like, the relationship that I was in because I'm not really stressed with this postpartum recovery. See, that is probably about the same amount. And she only drinks about 3 ounces. She doesn't even drink the whole 6 ounce, which I should have just poured out sick. I mean, three, and made a new bag. This is about four bottles for her right now. Oh, I spilled some yesi. It's too much right now, guys. I hate spilling my milk. I work so hard for. I don't know if she's playing or she's like, gonna catch like a tantrum real soon. But this is a little over five. Almost six Again. These breast bags are called kin. Kind. I. I guess you could call them. I call them kindy. I'm gonna tag them in the video or hashtag them, but they go for the bottom. You just snap them into the bottle and it's for a quick feeding. But we got about 5, 6, 11 ounces. I pumped out because I missed the feeding, but that's because little miss thing slept. Right, mamas? You let mama sleep. You know, she was tired. I was tired. Mama, you let me sleep. Guys. I bought her some bowls and it's the cutest thing in the world and I'm not sure if her hair is long enough. Let's say hi, guys. Say hi guys. Say hello. Marshmallow. I love this baby, guys. But yeah, that's my breastfeeding journey for the morning. I'm gonna try to shower before the kids wake up because I'm kind of sore down there, I guess from pushing her out. I'm still sore, so I'm going to try to soak for like 20 minutes before I have to wake them up at 6:30.

So once you pump milk, freshly pumped milk is good at room temperature for four hours. Once it goes in the fridge, it is good for up to four days. You can put it in the freezer for up to six months and a deep freezer for 12 months. What's important to know about once you take it out of the freezer? So let's say you take it out of the freezer and you put it in the fridge. Once the last ice crystal melts and it's in the fridge, that milk is only good for 24 hours. That last ice crystal, so most of it can be defrosted. But once that last little piece is melted, that's when the 24 hour timer starts. And then, you know, once you are ready to use the milk, once you've taken it out of the fridge, you know, heated it up, it's only good for two hours. So hopefully that helps with some timeline things. But again, I live in the US and these are our guidelines here. I only have an upright freezer. I do not have a deep freezer. So any milk that I keep will only be good for six months. So since I have such an excess and oversupply, I donate all of my milk. So I don't really have like a huge freezer stash that you might imagine. I actually only keep one brick on hand at a time for myself. But I do still have some colostrum from when he was first born that I'm keeping just, you know, in case.

This is from yesterday, last night and the night before. So two nights in a day. So let's see how much I get. Okay, so apparently I have some milk. This was full. This is 64 ounces. So let's bag the milk it Okay. I just added the the other four bottles. We'll continue bagging and my left thump to shut off so we'll see what I get. Come on. Right. Okay. Time for the reveal. We got a total of 109 ounces plus I fed Abby two of those two ounces on top of that so 111 ounces. I have 50 in here to donate 35 in here and 24 for my own personal stash. Hope you enjoyed."

So this is all the milk that I have for my 24 hour period. And I am now going to use these first to fill up my bottles and then the rest I freeze. And I'm currently. The bags I'm freezing the next couple days actually are going to be for myself. But then the next, the rest actually like forever go to the little baby I'm donating to. And I actually got like a really great update from her mom that she has gained a bunch of weight. Because when I gave her milk, actually not even a few weeks ago, we just started giving her milk, she had only gained 3 ounces since being born and she was a month old. So, you know, just was having a little rough time. And she. I don't know how many pounds, but she gained a couple pounds already just from my milk, which is like really awesome and insane. I knew that was gonna spill. All right, so sorry, I haven't really been posting too much. Okay. All that spilled milk is like, sorry, no triggering me. But we have just been trying to figure out the proper dose of medication for my son right now. As I talked about, we did get permission to give him like the proper dose, but it's like based on weight and also just like based on kind of the severity. So, you know, it's just like a lot of like playing around. So we had one night of him sleeping. Amazing. And then the past couple nights were not. But last night he slept 13 hours. He did get up, I think four times, but he was not hysterically crying or hyperventilating. So I think tonight we actually finally now know, like the perfect amount to give him. So I'm really excited to give that update and just hopefully get him better sleep because, you know, obviously as a parent, you know, you're going to be up with your kids. But, you know, initially, I'm not kidding, guys, it was every 10, 15 minutes he was up. It was really, really bad. So I'm really just excited for him to get quality of sleep. So that's all the bottles made and then we're gonna combine all this and that's how much I'm gonna freeze. All right, so here is how much I am freezing today. It's not like ideally where I like it. I used to be all the way up. Eye has been dipping because I did cut out a night pump like a few weeks ago. So I definitely think that's like finally regulating. And now I forgot a pump yesterday.

So last night I fell asleep, and my husband ended up washing all the bottles and pump parts for me. But he doesn't know how to load my sterilizer. He's never done that. And I never woke up to do it. So I haven't pumped any milk for donation today, which is fine. I've pumped all for my son, but my freezer is filled with milk. I don't have any more room up here in this freezer to store any more milk. If you're new here. I store it up here in this freezer just originally. This is where I freeze it to begin with. Then once this freezer is full, I move it to a deep freezer in my basement until I get my cooler box in from the donation center. And then I will get the milk out of my deep freezer in the basement, pack my cooler box, and ship it off to the milk bank. But this is full. So since I didn't pump any for donation today, I figured today would be a good day. But to go ahead, organize all my milk, I bag it up into bricks. I reuse my gallon bags. That's why they look like this, but better for the environment and better for my wallet. So I'm reusing those gallon bags. Gonna get this out, sort it. I'm going to write down how many ounces I did on each day because I've done a bad job at keeping track of that lately, and I want to get better. It's easier for me to reach my goal when I like specific numbers that I can look at to push myself to do better for the next day. So I'm gonna get all this out, and then I'll be back. All right, I got all the milk out. I've kind of been trying to sort it. I don't have a ton of counter space here, so I'm kind of just roughly sorting it. I've done a lot better freezing it flatter. This time. My hands are freezing, but I have, like, a cookie sheet on the bottom. And then I bought another cookie sheet finally, that fits. And I just sandwiched them, but I have two now, and it's freezing a lot. Flatter. Let me see. So, like, this one you can see is, like, not very flat. And then, like, one of my more recent ones you can see is, like, much flatter. You kind of can't tell in this video, but I promise you they're a lot flatter. I might still buy some free slats. Okay. I'm just trying to save some money. I'm not Rich. So now I'm going to just take an inventory on. I'm gonna write down the day and how much milk was donated on that day. And then I'm trying to think of, like, how I want to organize. I see some moms on here who are, like, super organized. I'd love to be like that. I see, like, they just write like, bag number one, and then they keep track of how many ounces are in that bag. So then when they go to pack their cooler, they just grab 400 ounces and they know every time. It's like a guessing game for me. If I start freezing, even flatter, I might be able to fit more. It's a learning process. Okay, I just sent my second cooler. I got the result. Well, not the results, but I got my ounce count today, and it was, I think, 408 ounces. That's a little bit more than I did last time. So I'm happy with that. And I'm going to keep track on here how much is in this bag. That way, in my notes app, I can put like, bag number one, 20 ounces or whatever. It'll be more than that. That way I can try to keep track and get on a better process here. I'm not too stressed. I've only sent two boxes in, so I don't want it to seem like I'm like, can't handle it. It's just a learning process. I've never done it before. Well, I guess I've done it twice, so it's getting better. It already got better from the first time to the second time, minus my son cooperating. That didn't get any better, and it probably won't. This was a good donation day. 37 and a half ounces. So in this bag, I fit 57 and a half ounces. Yep, 57 and a half ounces. And that's bag number one back here. Hopefully that's not in my way. Get bag number two out. Okay. So that's all I'm gonna fit in bag number two. And I did end up ripping it, but it's fine. Just a little hole here. This is just going into my deep freezer. And then before I send it to the milk bank, I take all the milk individual bags out of that and put it in my cooler box. So no big deal. Bag number three, I'm gonna see if they fit this nice better if I lay them down. I don't know if they will have never done it this way, but it doesn't hurt to try. I definitely think I could fit a lot more in here if I froze it flatter. That is for sure. These ones weren't frozen very flat. Well, I still honestly fit in more in there than I probably would have. I think what I'm going to start doing instead of waiting. So this was like June 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, if not the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, and then I didn't donate today. So this was almost like a week and a half, two weeks worth of milk. I'm gonna try to start doing it every other day, because then I would just be doing one brick and taking it to my freezer. And that would be a lot easier to manage than trying to do two weeks at a time, because it looks like I fit about six bags in here. This one? Yeah. This one has six. That one has six. They all have six. I'm gonna leave these two just up here, and I'll in a couple days, add these in with that brick, and I'll just make sure that they get sent out when that milk does. But that is all cleared out. I've got four bricks here, so I don't know how many ounces that I'll put it here. I'm gonna make my husband take this down to our scary, creepy basement and put it in our deep freezer. I still have a bunch of extra bags left over, but I think this system will work better numbering them and then keeping track of how many ounces are in each numbered bag. And also that'll help me go in order, because right now I've been writing, like, June 5th to June 10th on the bag. Well, when you're just in the basement trying to grab bags out of the deep freezer, you're like, okay, what day? What day did I already grab? Okay, where was that other bag? It's chaotic. I think this will go a lot smoother. So going to make my husband take this basement and load my sterilizer for the night. That way, tomorrow, everything I pump can go towards donation, because every bottle my son has is filled with milk in there from today's pump. So I hope everyone had a happy Friday, and I'll see you in the morning."," All right. So last night I fell asleep, and my husband ended up washing all the bottles and pump parts for me. But he doesn't know how to load my sterilizer. He's never done that. And I never woke up to do it. So I haven't pumped any milk for donation today, which is fine. I've pumped all for my son, but my freezer is filled with milk. I don't have any more room up here in this freezer to store any more milk. If you're new here. I store it up here in this freezer just originally. This is where I freeze it to begin with. Then once this freezer is full, I move it to a deep freezer in my basement until I get my cooler box in from the donation center. And then I will get the milk out of my deep freezer in the basement, pack my cooler box, and ship it off to the milk bank. But this is full.

Pumping video part two. It has been exactly 10 minutes, which is typically the length I pump for. And I do both sides at once. I don't know if I'm supposed to do that, but I do. And the other thing I was going to say is that this brand is great because it turns off the pumping when the tank is filled, so you don't have to worry about it overflowing or spilling out or anything like that. Okay. I don't usually get the same amount from each side, but I'm going to pull them out. Left side. Got it. Has markers on it, about 4 ounces and the right side about 3 ounces. Boom. Close up. That was the right and there's the left. Now I'm just going to pour them into milk storage bags and label them and set them into the fridge so that my nanny can give them to Milo while I'm working. While I'm doing this, I figured I would just share my current nursing and pumping schedule with you. So my son is now 12 weeks old and he eats four times a day. And we have him on a schedule of eating at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and then 8pm again. And he's now sleeping through the night for like 11 hours in a row. So he does not eat at night anymore. When it's a weekend or a day when we don't have the nanny, Michael, my husband, always does the morning feed at 8am I like to sleep in. So he wakes up and he pulls the milk from the fridge and makes a bottle and then at the rest of the feeds for the day. So 12pm, 4pm and 8pm, I will nurse him. But on days when we have our nanny here, by the way, this is how I get the air bubbles out. I like put it at the edge of the counter and I push it up until there's no bubbles and then I seal it real tight. Okay. So on days when our nanny is here, I don't feed in the morning either. Michael always does the morning feed and then our nanny will feed him at noon and 4, and at those same times, I will pump. So I pretty much pump at around 8:30 to 9:00am I pump at noon, I pump at 4, and then at night I nurse and then I also pump before bed. So 10:30, 11:00pm and then I'm working on weaning off my middle of the night pump. But I have recently been waking up around 5 or 6am and feeling the need to pump just to relieve the pressure. I'm not pumping to completion or anything. But I've got the bags gonna label them with the date, the time, the amount of ounces. Put them in the fridge. They'll last for four hours on the counter, four days in the fridge and four months in the freezer. Hope that was helpful and insightful and inspiring and enjoyable.

I have been adding all of my milk to the same bags throughout the day. Very similar to the pitcher method that people do. Except now I just need to separate mine into three ounce bottles in each bag. That way those bags can then attach to the bottle system that we use which is the kind twist system. I do have a link in that place that you know of where you can look at getting a free gift set. So if you ever tried or thought about trying this set, you can go there and try that out. But basically what I'm doing is giving him the three ounce bottles. I do blow into them so that way I can get a more accurate read on how much is in each one. But the germs are mine so it's not a big deal cuz he gets them anyways. So apparently this part did not record my voice, but basically all I'm saying is I have six bottles here. He gets three ounce bottles every two hours at daycare and so that way this will get him through about a day and a half away from me. Otherwise I exclusively nurse him at home.

That way those bags can then attach to the bottle system that we use which is the kind twist system. I do have a link in that place that you know of where you can look at getting a free gift set. So if you ever tried or thought about trying this set, you can go there and try that out. But basically what I'm doing is giving him the three ounce bottles. I do blow into them so that way I can get a more accurate read on how much is in each one. But the germs are mine so it's not a big deal cuz he gets them anyways. So apparently this part did not record my voice, but basically all I'm saying is I have six bottles here. He gets three ounce bottles every two hours at daycare and so that way this will get him through about a day and a half away from me. Otherwise I exclusively nurse him at home. But hope you guys have a great day and we'll see you tomorrow for the first pump of the day."

I'm grabbing a beverage. Can you hear me? Let's see. Good evening. I have a baby that doesn't want to sleep, and I have dirty bottles that are staring at me. So I'll show you how I clean them. So first one is disinfect my sink using this and give it a little scrubby dub dub and use my scrub daddy, which is looking kind of sad, but it's okay. We got them at Costco, so there's probably a replacement somewhere in the sink. Okay. And I'm gonna rinse this. Okay, we're disinfected. And I'm just gonna put this over here for a little bit. Now I'm gonna put my stopper and make sure my sink gets super, super hot. Hopefully you guys will see the steam that will come eventually. But I'm just gonna dump everything in. So my hackers are gonna get washed. This bottle is gonna get washed. Oh, and then I'm also gonna put in. This is the soap I'm using for him right now. Just something that's pretty natural I like to pick up. These bottles are gonna go in. My water gets, like, uncomfortably hot to a point where, like, I can't wash my dishes with it. So that's how hot I want the water to get. I didn't even come today because I was just staring at these breastplums like, I don't even want to wash it. So I found it's not much parts. I was just lazy. We went to the Banff Christmas market yesterday, and it was just a long day. Banff in general, when you go, is just a long day if you're visiting. Okay. Anything else I need to wash for him? I use this bag for the spritz method, so I'll wash this too. Okay. Getting nice and hot. Going to let this sit for around 5, 10 minutes, and then I'll come back and rinse everything now, actually, an hour, hour and a half later. Okay, hold on one second. So it's actually been an hour and a half. So my boyfriend's gonna help me because Atticus is a little bit fussy, so he's now just gonna wash everything now that the water is cooled down. The water's cooled down, right? It's so hot. Okay, well, it's cooled down enough for him to just scrub each part. Show them the stuff that you're using. So here's that one. He has this one and then this little one for the breast pump parts. Yes, yes, we're washing parts. So he's Just gonna do that. And honestly, we don't sterilize anything. This is definitely a lazy method. The only reason that I've been comfortable doing this is because he's born full term. So you don't have to worry about necessarily sterilizing everything. I just like to make sure that they do soak in extremely hot water. So yeah, as I was saying, I don't sterilize anything in Canada at least is what what I know and what I've been taught while I was pregnant. You're full term once you're 37 weeks and he was born at 39 weeks and he's taken bottles and obviously I've used the haka and everything but no issue. So that's just a tip for you. If you are struggling like washing parts and everything, I just skip the sterilizing and this method has worked for us for the last almost three months now. So just gonna go through and then maybe I'll time lapse us putting everything rinsing and Dr. You were just asleep and now you're awake but that's okay because you're a baby. Okay, so he finished washing everything. Now he's just gonna drain out the water and then give it a final rinse with some hot water. Sag meats that they're out now so that's the last thing to be washed. And now we got a clean sink, everything's nice and clean, laid out to dry on a clean cloth. When you're done you should have some clean dishes and a sleepy tv. Alright. Oh, and a very helpful boyfriend. Thank you.

So my hackers are gonna get washed. This bottle is gonna get washed. Oh, and then I'm also gonna put in. This is the soap I'm using for him right now. Just something that's pretty natural I like to pick up. These bottles are gonna go in. My water gets, like, uncomfortably hot to a point where, like, I can't wash my dishes with it. So that's how hot I want the water to get. I didn't even come today because I was just staring at these breastplums like, I don't even want to wash it. So I found it's not much parts. I was just lazy. We went to the Banff Christmas market yesterday, and it was just a long day. Banff in general, when you go, is just a long day if you're visiting. Okay. Anything else I need to wash for him? I use this bag for the spritz method, so I'll wash this too. Okay. Getting nice and hot. Going to let this sit for around 5, 10 minutes, and then I'll come back and rinse everything now, actually, an hour, hour and a half later. Okay, hold on one second. So it's actually been an hour and a half. So my boyfriend's gonna help me because Atticus is a little bit fussy, so he's now just gonna wash everything now that the water is cooled down. The water's cooled down, right? It's so hot. Okay, well, it's cooled down enough for him to just scrub each part. Show them the stuff that you're using. So here's that one. He has this one and then this little one for the breast pump parts. Yes, yes, we're washing parts. So he's Just gonna do that. And honestly, we don't sterilize anything. This is definitely a lazy method. The only reason that I've been comfortable doing this is because he's born full term. So you don't have to worry about necessarily sterilizing everything. I just like to make sure that they do soak in extremely hot water. So yeah, as I was saying, I don't sterilize anything in Canada at least is what what I know and what I've been taught while I was pregnant. You're full term once you're 37 weeks and he was born at 39 weeks and he's taken bottles and obviously I've used the haka and everything but no issue. So that's just a tip for you. If you are struggling like washing parts and everything, I just skip the sterilizing and this method has worked for us for the last almost three months now. So just gonna go through and then maybe I'll time lapse us putting everything rinsing and Dr. You were just asleep and now you're awake but that's okay because you're a baby. Okay, so he finished washing everything. Now he's just gonna drain out the water and then give it a final rinse with some hot water. Sag meats that they're out now so that's the last thing to be washed. And now we got a clean sink, everything's nice and clean, laid out to dry on a clean cloth. When you're done you should have some clean dishes and a sleepy tv. Alright. Oh, and a very helpful boyfriend. Thank you. Alright, see you later."

The official answer is unfortunately, no. I'm a lactation consultant and pediatric PA and I'm here to tell you why and what you can do instead. So there is a tiny chance that your baby could get sick from the bacteria of the milk that's kind of left there in between uses. And even though it is rare, ideally what we would love to you to do is wash them and dry them between uses. But listen, pumping is a grind. So here are a couple ways that you can do things to make it a little bit more manageable and feel a little bit less stressful. So if you have a dishwasher, use it, especially if it has a sanitizing cycle. And really just as long as you're using soap and water fits in there with under dishes perfectly fine. You can also get some extra pump parts. I think that's super helpful. Then you can just not have to worry about immediately washing the first set if you have another set that's already clean and then at the end of the day just kind of handle it and wash them all for the next day. Another good option is especially if you have a partner and you can delegate or have family who seems to be helping out a lot, delegate if you can have somebody else do it. So if you ever find yourself in a situation where it's just not feasible for you to be able to fully wash those pump parts, especially if you're at work, don't stress about it. As long as your baby is healthy full term, at least over the age of two months, it's probably okay for you to use that fridge hack every once in a while.

This is only my right side. And then this was my left side let down. I pumped this time with my Spectra Portable Gold. Synergy Portable Gold. Some. Some. And yeah, I love that freaking pump. I got that pump off of my insurance. I did pay more for it. It was like an upcharge, you know, because it's fancy and whatever, but I wanted that one and I love it. So, yeah, I pumped that y'all had seen. I like doing in one at a time because a lot of the times, most of the other pumps, you have to wear both at the same time. This one, you can pump one side at a time, which I like because there's plenty of times where I'm pumping and feeding at the same time. So that helps me personally and my modes of breastfeeding. Anyway, let's bag this milk. It is 2:40am and I'm gonna bag this milk and wash all these bottles and stuff. I still have, like, a couple little items that I can still use, like HAWKES and stuff I can use in the middle of the night. But this is. Let's bag this up. So, you know, to each their own. Everybody does their own stuff differently. You know, do your own research. Do stuff that suits you, your lifestyle. This is what I do. Okay. How I store my milk in the fridge is like, I'll have the first day, like, date on the bag set, and I fill each bag only to 5 ounces. I will write AM or PM. So I'll have a PM bag and an AM bag. And then when I fill one, I'll put it on top of whichever bag it's supposed to be on. Okay? So that's what I do in the fridge. I want to do the picture method, but I don't got no pictures yet. So, yeah, this is what I got going. This is all of my PM milk. I don't mix warm and cold. So, like, these are warm because these ones are fresh and those ones are cold. So these ones will obviously go together. So I just tried pr, Marianne. And for me personally, my how I do my window. Like I said to you, how I do my window? My window is like, for me, anything past, like, 8pm, 8 or 9pm I'll consider PM Milk because that's about the time that, like, you know, I would normally get ready for bed. So maybe for some people it's earlier. I don't freaking know. That's just what I do. All right? And then anything that I pump, like after 9am I consider a.m. milk. Because when I do my pump at, like, 8 or 9am that first pump, to me, that's p.m. milk, in my opinion, because I had been sleeping while all that milk was brewing. And so I like to try to really separate, you know, in my mind, the ammpml. That's what makes sense to me. So that, like, the PM milk is really, you know, hopefully saturated with melatonin. So when I give it to him, he be carving. Got to mix up all of them. This one definitely got a fat cap on there. Just mix them all up. Let's see. What's it? Look at this fat cap. Look. Look at, like, the separation. Like, all of this is fat, and then, like, this is, like, the water. Isn't that crazy? Women's bodies, y'all.

How many days can you keep milk in the fridge before it needs to be bagged? I was given this handy dandy magnet from my hospital when I gave birth that has all the different guidelines on here so I thought I would just read it to you when you freshly express milk. So when I pump it's good for four hours on the counter and I always set a little timer on our Alexa and then once the timer's up I put it in the fridge. In the refrigerator it is good for up to four days. So when I use my pitcher method, say I start on Friday, I will keep adding to my picture Friday, Saturday, Sunday and on Monday that fourth day, that's when I'll bag everything up. Even though my milk from Saturday and Sunday will still be good because I combined it with my Friday milk, I based it all on Friday. Lastly, it says from the freezer it says within six months is best but 12 months is acceptable and I'll end up having to go the 12 months because I still have no idea what I'm going to do with my freezer stash. I'm pumping enough daily that I I don't need to use my frozen milk now. The biggest thing that I find most important honestly is that leftover milk from a feeding after it's been warmed up it needs to be used within two hours but it can't be re warmed up. Okay, after two hours is when it goes down the drain. Now a little hack for that at least. The Dr. Brown's bottles is this swig or brumate cancoozie? I'll heat my bottle up in my bottle warmer and then for two hours I can leave it in here and it stays warm the entire time. I'm going to add this to my Amazon storefront under let's say Pumping Essentials. Let me know if you have any other questions about milk storage or anything like that. Also all my pitchers, the glass pitchers, the big ones, the smaller ones, everything is on my Amazon storefront under Pumping Essentials.","Replying to @dgardner93 Milk storage info #pumpingmom #overproducer #momsoftiktok #fyp #foryoupage #breastmilk #milkstorage #brumate #swig  Great question.

Even though my milk from Saturday and Sunday will still be good because I combined it with my Friday milk, I based it all on Friday. Lastly, it says from the freezer it says within six months is best but 12 months is acceptable and I'll end up having to go the 12 months because I still have no idea what I'm going to do with my freezer stash. I'm pumping enough daily that I I don't need to use my frozen milk now. The biggest thing that I find most important honestly is that leftover milk from a feeding after it's been warmed up it needs to be used within two hours but it can't be re warmed up. Okay, after two hours is when it goes down the drain. Now a little hack for that at least. The Dr. Brown's bottles is this swig or brumate cancoozie? I'll heat my bottle up in my bottle warmer and then for two hours I can leave it in here and it stays warm the entire time. I'm going to add this to my Amazon storefront under let's say Pumping Essentials. Let me know if you have any other questions about milk storage or anything like that. Also all my pitchers, the glass pitchers, the big ones, the smaller ones, everything is on my Amazon storefront under Pumping Essentials."

No, you'll pay less for sure. I also have a link in my bio if you guys are interested. I feel like they helped me, but everybody is different.

So I'm going to show you the hack I used to make his bottles, make sure they were sterilized and hopefully help some of you guys. So this here is a newbie sterilizing bag. You literally put your bottles in it, press this button and it sterilizes anything you put in it. Absolute game changer. Second thing I have is this. Now this is digital and it tells you the temperature of the water inside. So each night before bed, I would put bottled water into the kettle, boil it and then put it in this and it was ready for my morning bottles. But during the day when you're out and about, this is how I made bottles. So out and about. Hudson takes 7 ounces. So I would do 3 ounces of hot water. This kills any bacteria in any formula that you use. You must do a hot shot for most formulas. I then use these Aptmel ready made tablets. They are so handy. Definitely worth it for a holiday. So now I've got my formula in the hot shot. I now need 4 ounces of cold bottled water. So always take a bottle of cold water out the fridge, measure out my 4 ounces.

This is a great angle. Basically, I just take it off, tap this into any excess off, and then I lay it down on paper towels, and then I pour it in here. So basically, the inner chamber is where you put your milk, and then the outer chamber is where you put ice and water. You put a little bit of water, and it's supposed to keep it cold, but you do have to. If you pump more than once a day, then you have to be okay with adding your fresh pumped milk to cold milk.

So you want to make sure this is really tight or you're gonna waste all your milk because it'll all come out. So you can hear the ice in there, but you put it upside down.

That your baby can sleep through the night? My baby is almost five months. She's a couple days away from being five months. And I'm wondering, how did you drop the nighttime feedings? Like, this girl is just so used to eating every three to four hours that she just wakes up and eats every three to four hours, even at night. And I just need to know, how did you drop nighttime feedings? Also, you know, it's really exciting. Before this video ends, my job made me a mother's room at our office. I can't wait to go see it. I think it got done last week, Friday, so I just need to go check it out.","A pumping ASMR. How did you drop nighttime feedings?

So this was 3pm Work is very busy and I have dropped two pumping sessions. Now I pump six times a day because I cannot pump three times at work. I pump four hourly. Sometimes I go for five hours like today because we were very busy and I'm experiencing a dip in my supply simply because I dropped pump sessions and the stress of going back to work. It's so hard. I'm not coping. But I guess with time I will cope and be able to function again. My mind is just all over the place and I'm overwhelmed that I came back to work in a time where the unit is like super busy. We are very busy and we are short staffed. But I am glad that I am still able to pump and get enough for my son because I still like make more than what he takes in a day. So I'm really glad about that. So I pumped a hundred and sixty seventy mils. So I want to show you this cute bag that I got from Take a Lot. It's a pumping bag. It has a side where I put my my pump and a side that is insulated where I put my ice pack and my bottles. I will make another video where I pack this bag and show you how it is inside. It's very nice. It's very small. You can actually take it wherever and it is very spacious. You can actually fit like six bottles at a go.

I think I packed her entire nursery, whoops 😅 #workingmom #travelingwithbaby #packwithme #pumpingmom #makebottleswithme ","This week I have to travel out of town for work and I have a three and a half month old that I'm still nursing mornings and nights. So I'm a buyer for a large retailer in the south and traveling is something I typically do about six times a year. So with a new baby, this is an adjustment. Luckily, this time I have recruited my parents to come along with me to help watch the baby while I work and I'm in meetings all day. I know I'm really fortunate to have them come and help watch her while I'm working this time. I don't know what the next few times are going to look like yet. She may just have to stay home with her daddy, but since I'm still nursing her constantly, I just was not ready to leave her behind for four days. This is the first time I'm traveling with a baby, so I had no clue what I needed to be packing for her, but I pretty much just packed up her whole nursery, so hopefully there's nothing that we will need that we don't have. That's like my biggest fear is to get somewhere and then need something that we don't have. So I just pack everything. I also have to think about packing for myself because I have to pump while I'm still working and I'm not sure how that's going to look being in meetings all day. This time I decided to pack up her sterilizer and bottle warmer just so it's easy for my parents, so wish us luck.","Traveling for work with a 3.5mo!

Pump number two, finishing up in my car because I had to leave work early to go pick up Halle from daycare. If you're pregnant with a baby, baby list is the best register you can use because all these products are from different places and you can add anything from different websites to your baby list registry. Super convenient. So on my list for your registry is the LB pumps. These are the double pumps on baby list. You can actually start like a fund for an item. So like these are like an expensive investment and, and they can contribute to whatever they want, which is kind of a cool thing. Dapple wipes, this is another one. You want to have tons of those. This is a little cooler that you can actually keep in your freezer and transport your milk. A bottle holder is just the perfect size to fit in your diaper bag. Another item you're going to want is a Medela hand pump. Hope that helps give you an idea. I have a Amazon storefront with all my pumping supplies listed and if you have a baby list registry, you can actually just go and add all those items to your registry very conveniently.

So like these are like an expensive investment and, and they can contribute to whatever they want, which is kind of a cool thing. Dapple wipes, this is another one. You want to have tons of those. This is a little cooler that you can actually keep in your freezer and transport your milk. A bottle holder is just the perfect size to fit in your diaper bag. Another item you're going to want is a Medela hand pump. Hope that helps give you an idea. I have a Amazon storefront with all my pumping supplies listed and if you have a baby list registry, you can actually just go and add all those items to your registry very conveniently. So hope that helps."

I guess I did good. Maybe that first one was my right poop. So we ended up with 7 ounces altogether. That will definitely be my best pump of the day. I will pump at least two more times. Once more at work and probably once on the way home. And if I still don't have 15 ounces, then I will pump 1 7, probably.

I wish I knew sooner. If you pump, you know the absolute worst part of pumping is washing the parts. Learned this hack at some point during my first breastfeeding journey, but not soon enough. Breast milk can't stay out of the fridge for too long. Well, a few hours, but at the risk of bacteria growing within the same day. If you're going to pump multiple times, put your pumping parts in a big Ziploc bag and put it in the fridge. You don't have to wash the parts in between every single time you pump, you put them in the fridge. It'll keep that the little residue of milk cold and you can reuse them.

So I'll tell you already, I am so tired, but I have been called in to work at the hospital tomorrow. So I am going to go ahead and pack my working bag because when I'm going for a long day, my little bag is not going to cut it. So here is my new mom cozy tote bag. And I love this one because on the bottom it has a separate attachment where I can also store another pump. So this makes me happy because I always like to have a backup option because, you know, anything can happen. So I'm just assembling this part and I'm attaching the three dividers because the pump I'm going to bring does have two wearable cups and a traditional like motor, which you're going to see. Y'all hear me talk about my favorite, one of my favorite regular pumps all the time. So as you can see that little zipper there. So this part can come off if you don't want it on there. But like I said, I do today. Today, because, well, tonight, because tomorrow I feel like I'm gonna need it. And that's the bag by itself. So it has two handles and then it also has a strap, which I like the strap style because it just makes it easier to like to fling it over my arm. So let's start, you know, filling this bad boy up. I am bringing my wearable cups that go with my one of my favorites, the Rumble Tough breeze. I talk about this pump all the time. I love it. I like it traditionally and I like it with the cups. So that's what I'm packing. It's all nice and charged up, so I know I'm good to go on that. And the pockets on the inside have two insulated bottle areas, so I think I'm going to be good. And I have refrigerator, so that was my pumping spray and of course my electrolytes. I'll bring my big old jug of water, my favorite massagers. Both of these are actually, I think on sale right now, so you can check out the link. I love these bags. I love the word, the sayings on them. So I'm definitely packing three of these because whatever I pump tomorrow, I am not going to have to, you know, use for the next day cuz I'll be home. So I'm going to put them directly in the freezer. And of course I'm going to bring my new mom cozy M5. I do like this pump because it literally comes with everything you need. Like it has four different flange sizes in it from a range of 17 all the way up to 28, which is kind of unheard of. No pumps are doing that. And then it also has these covers that will protect any kind of milk residue or my flange spray that may or may not get left on it. So I don't ruin the bag. I gotta bring my snack. If, you know, you know, breastfeeding moms, we need snacks, and this is my snack of choice. Don't judge me. It doesn't always have to be healthy. Of course, my MD herbs, because, I mean, they work. And again, you know, I don't want to experience any dips in supplies. Of course, my pump parts and accessory wipes, I'm going to put those on outside. And my pump spray, my sanitizing spray. I have to bring me some hand sanitizer because, yeah, got to keep the hands clean. And I'm just making sure I got everything. This bag holds so much. I was like, so, like, surprised. And I'm just adjusting the areas how I want to put my straps on and where I wanted to put my wipes on, because I did want to put those on the outside of my bag. So that's pretty much it. This bag is. And it's still light. It doesn't feel heavy. So I'm happy about it and I'm impressed.

I was going to make a Pack my pump Bag with Me for Work video, but then I was super late and had to run out the door. So I'm going to make a Unpack my pump bag for Work with me video instead. So here we go. Bring two different pumps to work. So typically what I do is I pump in the morning when I wake up, which pretty much empties me. And then about 30 minutes to an hour later, I drive to work and I pump on the way to work with my wearable pumps, which gets a little bit more out each time. Usually about 2 extra ounces add to my morning pump. And typically I only use them on the way to work because I can't wash them at work. And I do not do the fridge hack anymore because it's not safe. Check the other video on my profile to see why I have an oddball. And I bring this hefty puppy to work with me every single day because it empties me so fast and I would rather heave it into the room and sit for 10 minutes than have to pump for 45 minutes with another pump. I bring my symphony with me every single day with that. I bring my parts. I usually have two plastic bags. I have one plastic bag with all my clean parts. I bring two sets of clean parts, pump two times while I'm at work. And I don't do the fridge hack anymore. So I need two sets of clean pump parts. And I bring another gallon bag to put the dirty parts into after I use them. So these are all dirty. I always make sure I have an extra gallon bag just in case I need one for any dirty parts or parts that have milk on them that will get milk all over my bag and make it smell bad. I've got my power cord, I've got my tubing. I've got my warming massagers. These are from Amazon. They're the well Comfort brand. I think they sold out of their doubles, so you might have to buy them individually. But I use these every pump. It makes everything so much faster. The heat and the vibration makes the milk flow so much faster. I was going to show you my cooler bag that I bring my milk home in, but I didn't have it with me at work today. And I just pulled this out from yesterday. Completely spoiled. Six ounces of milk. Okay. I had an emotional breakdown over that. So moving on. I have a really cool ice pack that has little ridges in it that the medal of bottles fit into. You can fit four bottles in this cooler bag. I usually bring this to work. I forgot to bring it today. Hence, 7 ounces down the drain. Lastly, I always bring a bag of milk rags. I have a bunch of these quick clean pump wipes just in case I need to clean something off. And I have pumping spray that I keep in my bag at all times. And that's it. I'm gonna go cry now.","What I bring to work every day for pumping - ft the most UPSETTING discovery of 7oz of spoiled milk 😭 angel babies, we got you covered today 👼 ##pumpingmom##breastfeedingjourney##pumpingtips##milkstorage##pumptok##pumpingmomsoftiktok##exclusivelypumping@@momcozy@@medela_official Hello.

I am currently exclusively breastfeeding my son but that could change and I am collecting excess breast milk using my hand expression pump called a haka that I suction to the opposite breast of the breast that my son is nursing on. It collects a lot of milk. It's really effective. In this one day I collected about 2122 ounces of excess breast milk just by using the haaka while nursing my son. While it might not be months until we use this breast milk, I'm getting in the habit of storing it and saving it for things like mixing with solids when you start solids or if my supply suddenly plummets and we can start relying on a bottle or if we decide to bottle feed sooner than later so my husband or my family can start feeding baby, this will be beneficial too.

And then I had two bags, which you'll see at the get to make with my bigger morning pumps. One was six and a half ounces and the other one was 7.25 ounces that I added to my freezer stash. Yes, as an under supplier, I do have a freezer stash, and that's a whole story that I can go into on a video if you guys would like. Just comment below on how I was able to get it. It's a little bit different than what most people, how they would get their freezer stash, but I'm really thankful that I able to even have one. And as of right now, I've got four gallon bags full of frozen breast milk for baby Girl in case something ever happens and I just lose my supply completely. But yeah, once I figured everything up, it ended up being like 37 point, like 8 or 9 ounces. But we're gonna round up and say 38 ounces for two days, which is absolutely fantastic. Happy about that. But yeah, I hope you guys had a great Friday, I hope you're having a great Saturday, and I hope you guys have a fantastic weekend. And Baby girl hopes you guys do too. Bye, guys."

I just put the formula in the hot water. And in terms of sterilizing, I'm super simple to use. This one from Kmart, it's just a microwave steam sterilizer. Maybe like 10 or $15. It was so cheap. I love. Amazing. I've just got some standard brushes that I use to wash the bottles. Before that, she just washed all of her bottles in a Tupperware container.

Me cleaning and preparing Kai's bottles for the following day. As a mom of two, I found that this is so much easier to me because I have a bottle when he wakes up and that boy wakes up hungry.

The measurements are over here. Just. Oh, okay. It looks like 3 ounces that I got with this. So the hole in this is huge. So pours out way faster too. Okay. And then let's see. My slacker side seams, like, slightly lacquers, probably the same. Okay, so I have this, which that seems about the same. So this is what actually it comes with. I've had a hard time pulling these little things out. Whatever. I'm not gonna try, but it comes with this plastic part, and it just hooks on to the collection cups, and then it just sits in your bra and runs your wall pump. Like a portable. I liked it so far. The suction on this is just way better than my portable pump, which I like too, but. So we'll see how much I get at my next pump. All right, it's time for my second pump of the day. I don't have, like, an advisory homeroom or whatever, so let's hook this bad boy up and see what we can get. All right, it's been 20 minutes, so let's see what I got for my second pump while at work. So again, I'm just gonna pop these puppies off, have my mom cozy. It's gonna make me nervous. I'm afraid it's gonna fall over one day, which obviously, this isn't gonna be that much. What? It's 2:30 now, and my first pump is at, like, 10:40, so obviously, like, it's not gonna be the same amount that I got this morning. I feel like this is pretty good. And then I can pump again on my way home. So then I just put my milk in the break room fridge. I have a miniature fridge in my classroom that I put these in, take out my little tubing, and I put all of this in this little pouch. This is just from a set of sheets and I just use it like so to keep everything together. I would say I do recommend these if you want like the power of a not portable pump. Like if you have a Spectra or I guess an LV is the same thing, but like a Lansino Medela. If you have milk just squirted out. If you have like a good wall pump that you really like and want it to be more discreet because you are pumping at work, I would definitely recommend these little cap. I forget what they call them, like capturing cups or something like that. They're from Idaho Jones. If you want the link, just comment and I'll DM them to you. But I 100 recommend them.","10/10 recommend!! #Teacher #teachersoftiktok #teach #firstyearteacher #teacherontiktok #secondyearteacher #fcsteacher #facsteacher #middleschoolteacher #secondaryteacher #youngteacher #futureteachersoftiktok #futureteacher #pumpingmom #pumpingatwork #pumpingmama #pumpingmilk #breastfeeding  Happy Monday. I just got done pumping, so let's see how much I got with my new pumping setup. Okay, so for my, like, not portable pump, I guess you could say it is portable kind of. But, like, I have to carry this around. I have this one that I got through insurance, and it's the Zombie. I think it's Z2. And it has the normal flanges. But I ordered collection cups from Idaho Jones, and I used them, I think twice. But I just use them, like, on my before bed pump.

Right now, the bottles are 10 to 15% formula. The rest is breast milk. I already prepped this with formula and I forgot to film. So I'm going to show you with just a teeny tiny amount of formula and explain how I would do it. Let's stick to nice round numbers and say that you are making two 5 ounce bottles. So 10 ounces total of milk. If you were doing a ratio of 10% formula to 90% breast milk, that would be 9 ounces of breast milk and 1 ounce of formula. So right here in this little standalone bottle, I have one ounce of formula that I've already mixed up. Into this, I would then add the 9 ounces of breast milk. The most important thing about this method is to always mix up the formula separately and according to package directions at the correct ratios with water and then combine it with the breast milk. I'm just going to go ahead and add it to my pitcher because I don't want to waste it. I'm going to fill these up to four ounces tonight because she's taken a couple four ounce bottles and I would rather just kind of have it prepped. I still have the rest of this pitcher. And so now whatever I pump overnight, I'm going to store in baggies and rebuild my stash. I destroyed my stash when I had mastitis, and I'm so glad I had it. Like that's the purpose of having a stash. But it was traumatic realizing I had no backup and I was only pumping just enough because my supply had tanked. Anywho, that is how I mix my formula into my breast milk and stretch my breast milk even further, make it last longer, and give myself the opportunity to build a stash. I'm going to bring these upstairs the mini fridge.

Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out. And this one has to be tight or your water and your ice will leak out. So hopefully that's okay. And then I like to lie it this way so the milk can touch the water and the ice.","I got a clogged milk duct on Easter, now my milk supply is lower then normal. #pumpwithme #cloggedmilkduct #pumpingatwork #7monthold #milksupply #pumping  I had a clogged milk duct on Sunday, and ever since then, my right side has producing less. Like, 2 ounces less. 2 ounces less. Normally 4. It's producing the same as my left side. Left side, 2 ounces, right side, 2 ounces. So I either got mastitis or just a clogged milk duck on Sunday because I woke up with a painful booby. Hold that thought. One of my little Korean mamas didn't get her Diet Coke, but it's because we are out of stock on it. See, now what was I saying? Oh, yeah. So I woke up Sunday with a clogged milk duck, really painful booby this side, and I had severe chills. Like, severe chills. I was so cold, I was shaking, and I wanted to go in the. In the shower to massage my boob and run the hot water on it. And I was even cold in the shower, and the. The temperature of the water was so hot. And then I got out and I was just, like, shaking. Luckily, that only lasted maybe an hour or two. And then after that, I had heat flashes. And then after that, headache, body aches. Like, it's crazy what us women go through just to feed our kid, you know? Like, I mean, no, I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I would go through any pain for her to have breast milk. But it's just like men. We go through everything. The labor or pregnancy, first of all, hard for most people, then labor and delivery, then postpartum, and then you have to deal with clogged milk ducts when you get too much milk or clogged milk or whatever. Like, it's just. It's wild. And men don't get anything. They get blue balls. Anyways, that's my complaint of the day. Us women are strong as shit, and men ain't shit. Just kidding. They're all right. They're all right. But if men have anything, it's the audacity. I just tightened this, and then now I can't. Oh, there. This one has to be really tight or else your milk will leak out.

My morning pump, got roughly the same amount I normally get. That one was actually a lot more than I normally get. I got up to 150mils with two pumps, which is really good. I always thought I'd be one of those mums that filled it to the brim. But I guess my supply isn't as big as I thought it was. It was with my daughter. I got heaps when I was pregnant. Well, when I had my daughter anyways, I put the dishes away and did the dirty dishes. I had to go to an appointment with Bug, so my sister looked after my older kids. So this pump was at my sister's house. Came home and cooked dinner. We had tacos, nothing but cheese, salsa and mints. Whenever I buy vegetables, lettuce and stuff like that, nobody eats it, but then when we need it, we never have it. So I just cut that up, ran a sink to keep on top of the dishes, put onion in with garlic, then realized that I put it on the wrong stove top, added in the mints, did the kids bottles and my breast pumping stuff, added the taco seasoning, served it up, forgot to take a video of the kids stuff. Then I just labeled all the bags with dates and meals. I got seven bags, one being 40 mils instead of 50. I was meant to show my freezer stash but I totally forgot to because I ended up reorganizing it because there's just too much at the moment and I'm trying to keep space for like icebox because they're priority to my daughter. So I just started bagging it up like normal. I need to get more bags. I've gone through quite a few of them so that's on my shopping list. I want to start doing cleaning videos and like fridge stock videos again so. So keep an eye out for them. They should be coming back very soon. But a lot of my videos are being shadow banned even though I haven't been showing much boob in it. And it's kind of bullshit that they're shadow banding me, but nothing much I can do about that.

My morning pump, got roughly the same amount I normally get. That one was actually a lot more than I normally get. I got up to 150mils with two pumps, which is really good. I always thought I'd be one of those mums that filled it to the brim. But I guess my supply isn't as big as I thought it was. It was with my daughter. I got heaps when I was pregnant. Well, when I had my daughter anyways, I put the dishes away and did the dirty dishes. I had to go to an appointment with Bug, so my sister looked after my older kids. So this pump was at my sister's house. Came home and cooked dinner. We had tacos, nothing but cheese, salsa and mints. Whenever I buy vegetables, lettuce and stuff like that, nobody eats it, but then when we need it, we never have it. So I just cut that up, ran a sink to keep on top of the dishes, put onion in with garlic, then realized that I put it on the wrong stove top, added in the mints, did the kids bottles and my breast pumping stuff, added the taco seasoning, served it up, forgot to take a video of the kids stuff.

I’m not here to shame or create fear, but please do your own research so that our babies can be the safest they can be. #pumpingmom #fridgehack #breastfeedingjourney #pumpingtips #milkstorage #pitchermethod #medelasymphony #momcozy #momcozypumps #exclusivepumping #pumpingmama #pumpingmama  ","If you've been using the fridge hack for your pump parts, watch this video. I'm using the fridge method for my pump parts, by the way. This is not the fridge method. This is the pitcher method. The fridge method is when after you pump, you take your pump parts, you put them in a plastic baggie and you put them in the fridge without rinsing or washing them. Then when you're ready to pump next, you take them out of the fridge, you use them, and then you do the same thing, put them in a plastic bag, put them in the fridge without washing or rinsing. So throughout the whole day, milk builds up on your pump parts and by the end of the day, there's milk on your pump parts that got on there at the very beginning of the day. Great, convenient way to not wash your pump parts. If you're an exclusive pumper and you hate washing things, you would only have to wash them once at the end of the day. However, I've been using the fridge hack for quite a while and I saw several posts in the last few days that were a wake up call and I'm not gonna use the fridge method anymore. Several people's babies have gotten super duper sick because of the fridge hack because of bacteria that can grow on the pump parts. If you think about it, you're not gonna use a bottle. You're not gonna take the bottle that your baby eats from and put it in the fridge in between feedings and use it like the whole day. You wash it in between every feeding because the bacteria that gets on the bottle. So why are we doing this with our pump parts when our pump parts are touching the milk that our baby's gonna drink? So I'm not judging anybody. I literally been using this hack for quite a while, but these several posts about people's babies getting sick and I believe two people's babies have died because of this. It might be a convenient way to avoid washing things multiple times throughout the day. But is it really worth that risk to our kids? Is it really worth the risk that our kids could get sick or even die just for this convenience of putting our parts in the fridge and not having to wash them every single time? I'm not going to use the fridge hack anymore and I would encourage everyone to do their own research and consider not doing this fridge hack anymore because I don't think it's worth the risk to our babies. The reason that bacteria can grow is because every time you take those parts out of the fridge, they warm up, then you Put them back in the fridge, cool down, back out, warm up, back in, cool down. And so every time your pump parts warm up, more bacteria is introduced. So if you're doing this over and over and over again and by the end of the day you've done this six, seven, eight times, there's so much bacteria on those pump parts that is now getting into the milk that you're feeding your baby. I am not a mom of judgment, like I said, so if you've been doing this, there's no shame. It was really easy, it was very convenient, it was a great TikTok hack. But I'm not gonna do it anymore because it's not worth the risk to my baby. If you don't have time to clean your pump parts in between every single pump session, that's okay. Order more pump parts, then you can wash everything at the end of the day just like you would with the fridge hack. But you don't run the risk of your baby getting sick or even dying. Now, lots of influencers that have been pushing this fridge hack thing and I think that's really, really dangerous. I just wanted to come on here and share that I've seen those posts and it really changed my mind on the fridge hack. And I would encourage you to do your own research and see if it's something that you want to keep doing at the risk of your baby's health and well being and possibly even life. Still doing my trusty picture method because the CDC said that this is just fine, but I will not be doing the fridge hack with my pump parts anymore.","If you’ve been using the fridge hack for your pump parts, please watch this video.

So let's make bottles. Making six bottles and we're gonna put five ounces in each. We were doing six ounces but my, I didn't have enough milk to cover six ounces and Anthony wasn't drinking the whole thing every time. And so I would rather, if he's really hungry, I would rather just top off one of his bottles with an extra ounce or two when I need it, then waste a bunch because that if you are an EP exclusive pumper, you know how much that emotionally hurts when you have a bottle that doesn't get finished and you have to throw it out. I go by the two hour rule. Once I heat up a bottle in the bottle warmer and or if I don't warm it up once it touches the, the baby's mouth because the mouth has bacteria in it, I go by two hours for formula. I believe it's one hour, but we don't use formula right now, so I go by the two hours. So if he doesn't finish it, we'll play for a little bit, we'll do some tummy time, we'll read a book, we'll talk, we'll hang out. And then when he starts to get fussy, like he's wanting to go down for a nap, I will change his diaper, swaddle him or change his clothes, get him ready for his nap, and then give him the last little bit of the bottle if it's been less than two hours, simply because I don't want to waste it. And I also think he'll nap a little better if he gets a little top off before he goes to sleep. There we go, one more. I've been focusing on trying to eat more food recently and I've noticed that if I have a really good day of eating really healthy, nutritious food, the next day I have a better go of pumping. So that's exciting and fun for me because I get to eat and I do want to lose baby weight at some point, but right now I'm not really focused on that. And you know, it can be tough because not a lot of my pre pregnancy clothes fit. So I wear a lot of like baggy stuff like this. But my worth is not based on how I look and I'm not in that season of life right now. I will be someday maybe after I'm done pumping or when my next baby, when I'm done having babies. But I don't know. A lot of, you know, me, but I'm a nurse and I just see a lot of health complications related to people being overweight. And so that is definitely something that I intend to focus on and becoming healthier. And getting back to how I was active pre pregnancy when I met my husband. Just hiking, walking, running, all the things. I know it'll be hard. I know it's like will be maybe the second or third hardest thing I'll ever do, but it's something that I've been thinking about recently and something I really want to dedicate myself to, but just not right now. And that's okay. I used to have, you know, body image issues. Every teenage girl and lots of teenage boys deal with that, and it was very unhealthy for me in middle school and high school. But, you know, I'm older now, and it's something that I just tell myself that it's something I can work on slowly and surely and get better and be healthy, because I want to be a very active, healthy mom when my kids are older so I can play with them and do sports and do all the things.

First, we're going to start with my Texas Tushy double cooler. In this first cooler portion, I've got two Medela bottles and then my Medela pumps and flanges. And I already have my inserts inside them. And I've also already tested it. Two ice packs will fit on top of these, and then I'll be able to zip it up just fine. For the bottom portion, I have my tubing, my power cord, and my pumping in style. My Medela pumping and style. And then I have this little goodie bag. So in here, I have anything I could possibly need while pumping at work. I have disposable nursing pads. Goodness, I drew a blanket. I have freezer bags, milk storage bags, whatever you want to call them. I have this sanitizing, like, microwave sanitizing thing, so that way, if I need it, I have it. I have a Sharpie for the milk storage bags, lanolin for just in case. I'll also add my pumping spray in here. I just finished pumping, so I haven't added it yet. I have cleaning wipes to be able to clean my pumps in between pumping sessions. And I'll also do the refrigerator hack, just because I'm not going to be able to have time to sit there and wash, sterilize. And I also have Medela pumping or pumping pump cleaning spray. Next, I have just this little Medela cooler, but inside of it I have two backup milk freezer storage bags and then a small thing of lanolin. I have a Spectre bottle, and then I have my wearable pumps for just in case. And the motors are charging right now, but I am packing these for just in case I'm not able to nurse Wyatt before I leave for work and things like that. It's just good to have backups. Obviously, this setup isn't going to last forever. I plan on getting different pumps. This is just what I've got to work with. And it'll do until I can get either a better wearable pump or a better wall pump. It just really depends. I haven't been back to work in almost a year, so wish me luck.","Im working with what i got i just hope i wint be gettjng full or uncomfortable during my shift. #pumpingmom #pumpingatwork #breastfeedingmama #momlife #newmom #clothdiapermama  Since I'm going back to work, I'm going to show you what I've packed for pumping purposes for back to work.

You can combine morning and night milk, different temperature milk, combine it all together. Once you have that final bag, you can put it in the freezer. If you never have a final bag, you're still a great mom. Frozen milk will last 12 months in the freezer. If you have an inside freezer, it six to 12 months. If you have an outside freezer, definitely 12 months. Breast milk warmed will last three hours. So if you don't know if your baby's going to finish it, I suggest starting with less and then adding more. Unless you know your baby's going to finish it. Once you warm it, three hours. You have two hours from the time your baby starts drinking a bottle to finish it. No matter if it's warm, no matter if it's cold. Two hours from the start to finish that bottle before you need to discard it. Formula will last 24 hours in the fridge for an untouched bottle. That means if you make a bottle of formula, it in the fridge and the baby hasn't touched it, you can leave it in there for up to 24 hours. This way you have your bottles ready to go. Once the baby starts drinking the formula, once it touches their lips, one hour. I don't play any games with formula. Once the baby starts eating it, you have one hour to finish that.

I also have a big bag that is like my pumping bag that I bring with me. And in my pumping bag I store my pumps in plastic baggies. I bring them already put together. I use the Willow Go's. So I bring one set already put together in one baggie and then another set of empty containers, like clean containers in a separate bag so that I can pump more than once. I also keep a thing of like cleaning wipes to wipe down the table. I never set them directly on the table, but I just like to have a clean area. And then I bring these dapple pump wipes in my bag and then obviously breast milk bags. And so I'll just pump, put it in this bag and then put the bag in here. And then when I'm done pumping, I just put my pump parts in this bag, close it and then remember I have an extra set of containers so I can pump more than once and then I just throw it all in this bag. Pretty not that super simple, but I figured it out and it works well for me. I have pumped on 12 hour days, 8 hour shifts, day shift, evening shift. I've pumped in my car. I've pumped literally through any circumstances at school, clinical days, just I've pumped during like day clinicals when I went to house calls and had to pump in a stranger's car.

I also keep a thing of like cleaning wipes to wipe down the table. I never set them directly on the table, but I just like to have a clean area. And then I bring these dapple pump wipes in my bag and then obviously breast milk bags. And so I'll just pump, put it in this bag and then put the bag in here. And then when I'm done pumping, I just put my pump parts in this bag, close it and then remember I have an extra set of containers so I can pump more than once and then I just throw it all in this bag. Pretty not that super simple, but I figured it out and it works well for me. I have pumped on 12 hour days, 8 hour shifts, day shift, evening shift. I've pumped in my car. I've pumped literally through any circumstances at school, clinical days, just I've pumped during like day clinicals when I went to house calls and had to pump in a stranger's car. And this is truly what works best for me. So hopefully it's helpful. Let me know if you have questions."

I am on my way to my first day back at work, and I am a little bit nervous. I've been on maternity leave for three months, and so now I'm back, and some things have changed. We're at a completely new building, and there are just a couple things I am not used to. For example, like needing to pump every two, two and a half hours. So I have my portable pump with me. I've got a little lunchbox thing with some ice in it to be able to keep the milk cold while I'm there. Because I also. They have a fridge there. But I felt so weird putting, like, my breast milk where everybody else puts their lunches. Like, that just looks. That just seemed too weird to me. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna get my own little lunchbox that I can put my stuff in. And as far as I know, they do have a place kind of like a maternity room or something that I can go in. But we're gonna see how it goes. I'm a. Like I said, I'm a little bit ner. And then let's share with everybody. And so I'm afraid of. Okay, so their maternity room has its own little fridge here, so you can put all your stuff there. So you don't even need to put it in the fridge with everybody else's lunch. They have this beautiful rocking chair you get to sit in, and you can enjoy this beautiful view. It awkward. I'm just gonna put my pump parts in a bag dripping on the table. I'm using the Mom Cozy. I believe it's the S12 Pro. Yep. So much better than the other. The other version that they. They have, or, like, the lesser version. Definitely worth getting for work, at least. I'm just gonna keep those in the fridge too. That's that. So pumping is finished. My team was super awesome at just understanding and letting me just leave when I needed to. They showed me where the room was. This fridge that's in here isn't used for anything else, so I don't have to worry about other people seeing it in there or trying to get their lunches out or anything. So that's super nice. This is a new building, so they're still putting a lot of things in, you know, in places and unwrapping things and stuff. So they are planning on putting more things in here to, you know, snacks and water and things like that for moms who are nursing. So it's definitely been a good experience so far. Okay, my day here is over. We're just gonna be transferring this into this cooler that I have. I'm just gonna wash these at home since I didn't end up pump. Gonna go home early instead. So here we are. All right, we did it. We made it through our first day back at work. I actually ended up just pumping on the way home since I was, like, getting really close to it being painful. So that's what we're doing now. We're headed home. And I definitely miss my babies like crazy, but luckily, you know, the job that I have is pretty flexible, and they're giving me, like, a two to three week grace period of just being more flexible with my hours and just making sure that I really have, you know, the. Everything that I need to be able to pump at work and be able to breastfeed at home and all those fun things. So I'm so grateful for my team and just everybody at my company that is allowing me to do this, but definitely excited to get home and see my little babies.","First day back as a working mom to twin newborn boys 😬 #newtoncrew #twinboys #twinmom #firsttimeparents #workingmom #pumpingatwork #pumpingmom #momtok  Alrighty.

I said I was gonna do this for, like, a long time, so now I'm actually gonna do it. So I'm gonna show you how I pump for a full day at work. So I'm driving to work right now. I just got here, and it's just before 9:00. It's like 8:50. This is the key to pumping at work, like, period. You can put warm milk in here, and it's similar to putting it in the fridge. It'll come. So you can either fill this middle section with ice, which is what I did today, because I'm going to pump three times, which means that I need the bigger compartment for milk, or you can switch it. You can put ice in here and you can put milk in here. So the timing works a little differently every day. But my favorite way that it works is when I can pump in the car on the way to work. I love doing it this way because I buy myself like four hours and I don't have to pump until like, one. I'm using my Kiss Bobo 1508 because there's no external motor, and it's like a really, really easy, simple way to pump when you're driving. So this is normally my biggest pump of the day. So this is a. This is a pretty big pump for me. I'm not going to be able to tell you exactly how much it is because I'm pouring into the Sarah's chill, which doesn't have the measurements, but I would say that that was probably close to 10 ounces. It comes to about here. Okay, so this is warm milk that I just pumped. So I'm gonna put it in here. And then I'm taking my, like, ice cold center chamber and putting it in here. Oh, my gosh. Putting it in here. And now I'm just throwing this in my bag. Okay, second pump of the day, I'm gonna pour into a glass as opposed to into my Sarah's Chill. So I'm not mixing warm and cold milk. But if I'm in a pinch, like, I'm traveling for work tomorrow. And if I'm in a pinch, I will just mix them. You can do something called flash freezing, where you pour. Pour the warm milk over the really cold part of the Saros chill. And it helps make it as cold as possible before you just mix them together. So if you're going to pinch whatever, that's what I do. But I am lucky enough to have a fridge in this pumping room so I can bring this up to. Down to the same temperature. And mix them together. At the end of the day I'm using my mom cozy V1s. So it's just about three ounces from one side. So that's about five. That is like maybe closer to five and a half. That's pretty average for what I pump at work during the day. So I'm going to put this in the fridge and along with that I have a plastic bag and I'm going to put these used pumps in here and put them in the fridge too. I know this is not CDC approved but a lot of moms do it. Otherwise I would have to wash the pump every single time and I don't feel like doing that. I don't have the time. Okay, we're back. I'm gonna take this five and a half ounces and add it to my Sarah's Chill where I put my pumped milk from this morning. So this is now cold, it's been in the fridge and I'm adding it to other cold milk that is in my Sarah's Chill. Now I'm going to add what I just pumped to this and put it back in the fridge. I never look at how much I'm pumping while I'm pumping because there's like this psychological aspect to pumping that I've learned about. Some people do something called the sock method where they put a sock over their pumps. I don't have to do that cuz it's under my shirt at work. But I don't look until the very end. So I don't know how much I'm pumping. Because sometimes you can pump more that way. I think there's some scientific proof to that actually. I'm not even joking. Okay, so that's just about five again. So this is now going to go back into the fridge. This is my last pump of the day at work. So now I have my two pumps from the day in here and my third pump here. So I'll put this in the fridge and then right before I leave for the day I will add this to this and then take it home and then I will dump it into a pitcher and put it in my fridge. Okay, I'm about to leave for the day. So this now cold milk is going in with the other cold milk. There's one full day of pumping at work. Okay, so I'm back home. This is what's left over of my fresh milk from today after all the bottles that the baby drank today. And here's my milk that I pumped today. We have about 4 ounces left here. Okay. And that's almost exactly 24. So we pumped 20 ounces at work today, which means I was right about that first pump. It was probably right around 10 ounces. I'm still learning about pumping at work, so if you have any other questions or ideas, let me know.","A full day of pumping at work.

I do this using a dry erase marker because it easily comes off. The next thing I want to note is that if it's been sitting in the fridge for a couple days, the fat will separate. So you want to make sure that you swirl it all together to get it off the sides and make sure that you're evenly pouring it when you store it. I also like to use a bottle to measure the ounces that you're storing. I find that the bags are a little confusing and not very accurate. The next thing is labeling the bag with the date and the size I mix AM and PM milk. I just find that it's way easier when mixing milk together. The next thing I do is use a flange to pour the milk into the bag. This just helps prevent it spilling out of the sides. You don't have to do this, but I find that makes it easier. I think that the next best practice is to get all the air out of the bag. I find that it's easiest to use the side of the counter to do this. Just press it up, push up until the air gets out. Before washing the bottles in warm soapy water, I like to actually rinse them out in cold water. I find that this helps get the fat off of the sides of the bottle. The best Freezing the bags flat is best for optimal storage space, so I use a sheet pan to do that and I have a designated spot in my freezer. Once they're frozen, I make a brick in a gallon bag. You stand them up straight and then lay two on top. It should fit 10. Then I like to label with the month and the year and the number bag that it is. This helps determine what bag I should use for the oldest milk. Hope this helped.","1. Label the bottle in the fridge with the date using a dry erase marker 2.

Planning and prep for a day out and about #exclusivepumping #exclusivepumping #pumping #pumpingmom #pumpingmama #milkstorage #fyp,"Okay, so let's talk about how to plan and pack for a day out. Hopefully this is helpful because honestly, there's days where I still feel like I'm trying to figure it out. So where I usually start is I try to think through how long am I going to be out of the house and how many bottles does that mean I'm gonna need. So if I'm gonna be out of the house, say from 10:00 to like 4 or 5, I'm gonna pack a 12:00 bottle, a 2:00 bottle, a 4:00 bottle, and I'm going to bring an extra bottle just in case. Now I use the two hour time frame just because my guy pretty regularly is wanting a bottle at the two hour mark. Now he is going a little bit longer now that he's getting a little older. So sometimes I won't take as many, but that's something you can feel out with the patterns of your own baby. Now, when it comes to factoring how many times are you pumping while you're out, and that gets into all the mental math of how much milk am I supposed to be bringing with me. Now if you're pumping every two or three hours, you're probably going to be pumping more frequently while you're out and about. So that means maybe you prep less bottles and you're going to feed fresh that day and just sort of maybe throw the pitcher method out the window if that's what you're doing. Or factor that in to how many empty bottles you may need to bring. With all of these, figuring out time frames and how many bottles and how many pumps and all that, I often err on the side of caution and I'll bring too much stuff and I don't care. I'd rather have too much stuff than not enough. Then it's time to pack. Always keep your ice packs in your freezer. That way you never have to worry about them not being frozen when you're ready to go. So throw those in there. As I mentioned before, I like to bring extra bottles, empty ones, just in case I can use them for storage or for feeding if I need to. So then you have to think through, am I going to be able to clean things while I'm out and about. I often try to plan my pumps so that I really only have to do it once if I have to. But if not, I think about do I need to bring cleaning supplies? So I usually will bring my hand pump and then I like to bring extra storage containers for what I pump. And if you're bringing an electric pump, my tip is to just use one flange for your pump. If you have to pump more than once, then you don't have to worry about cleaning. So use one flange for one session, another flange for another. Pause for checklist.","Reply to @xmikagrace  checklist at the end!

So I would recommend buying soap sheets. I do have everything that I have linked in my storefront, but that, that's what I bring. Honestly, I do bring another water bottle. So it's this. I do fill this up with chia seeds, you guys. Also, I'm sure that if you're doing instacart, you are delivering out of your own vehicle. Try to find a sec. A secluded area or somewhere where you're able to just like slip your breast pumps in and just chill for a bit. You can pump while you're driving, but if you're going to be getting off, it might. I've done it before and I just spill my milk. It's. I don't think it's worth it. But try to find a place where you're able to like pull off to the side and just pump. Try to snack real quick. Try to hydrate yourself as you're pumping. But that's honestly what works for me. For the most part though, it is. It is not that hard if you.

Inside my lunch bag, I do hold quite a bit of things, typically two to three water bottles, a body armor. See my snacks, the storage bottles, the. The milk storage bottles. That's what I bring. And then of course in my backpack, I do bring soap sheets. Those I recommend just to wash your hands because obviously I don't think you want to be putting your, you know, everything that you've collected throughout the day onto your breast pumps or, you know, the bottles. So I would recommend buying soap sheets. I do have everything that I have linked in my storefront, but that, that's what I bring. Honestly, I do bring another water bottle. So it's this. I do fill this up with chia seeds, you guys. Also, I'm sure that if you're doing instacart, you are delivering out of your own vehicle. Try to find a sec. A secluded area or somewhere where you're able to just like slip your breast pumps in and just chill for a bit. You can pump while you're driving, but if you're going to be getting off, it might. I've done it before and I just spill my milk. It's. I don't think it's worth it. But try to find a place where you're able to like pull off to the side and just pump. Try to snack real quick. Try to hydrate yourself as you're pumping. But that's honestly what works for me. For the most part though, it is. It is not that hard if you. Once you get into a routine, Good luck, mamas."

These are all the things I pack when I'm away from baby or when I'm at work. So of course the pump, the charger, and extra pump parts just in case. Sometimes I store my parts in between pumping sessions in a Ziploc bag in the fridge. Hakkas are optional, but I'm bringing them for this trip I'm going on milk, storage bags, soap, and a brush that is just for cleaning your pump parts. I bring a Sharpie to label my bags with the date that I pumped, a cloth to lay out the parts to dry, and a cooler bag to store the milk when I'm not near a fridge. I keep a basin in my locker at work so I don't have to wash the parts in the sink, but a bowl works too. Happy pumping.","What I pack in my pumping bag for when I’m away from baby on a trip or at work!  #pumpingmom #breastfeedingtips #pumpingbag #pumpingatwork #pregnant #postpartum #pumpingtips #milkstorage #maternityleave  If you're a pumping mom.

Lets try to empower and motivate other women to do what is best for their babies, and not what was best in your experience. Every baby, and every mama is different. #spontaneoustriplets #empower #fedisbest #breastfedbaby #pumpingmama #tripletpregnancy #makebottleswithme ","Hey, mamas, it's that time again. Let's make bottles for my triplets off the milk I pumped today. First thing I'm going to do is clean off my countertop with all the clean bottle parts and put them where they belong. Then I will start making the bottles for the triplets to get us through the night and half the day tomorrow. I get so many questions about how I'm mixing formula with my breast milk. Essentially, it's just a half a teaspoon per every 3 ounces of breast milk. Now, this is just something that our pediatrician has us doing because our babies were premature. So essentially, we need their growth to catch up to a baby that was born at term. This isn't something that everyone needs to. You're considering it. Please talk to your doctor first. Also get a lot of questions about my supply and if I'm able to keep up with the triplets. And the answer is not entirely, but I'm pretty close supply definitely waivers. And I try to be really consistent with my pumping schedule as well as making sure I'm eating enough calories and staying hydrated to keep up. I try not to kill myself over it. If I have enough today, wonderful. If I don't tomorrow, that's okay too. Lift each other up as mamas fed as best. It really doesn't matter. Thank you guys for watching. I hope you have a great day.","I keep seeing posts from other mamas getting hate for not breastfeeding, or for breastfeeding when baby is not fully tolerating her diet.

The triplets are all asleep. Let's get these bottles made before they wake up starving. The first pump of the day is so satisfying. I don't know about you ladies, but I wake up fully engorged. A couple people in my last video said that every time you spill breast milk, it goes to the babies in heaven. I love this and it made me feel a lot better considering I'm a total klutz and I spill it every time. Too tired to do math every time I have to fortify this breast milk. So I made a look. Cheat sheet. Tomorrow, the triplets have their first pediatrician appointment since we started fortifying my breast milk. A couple of you asked why I was adding formula to my breast mil, and the reason being is because Breast milk is 20 calories. My triplets are born at 34 weeks and 4 days, so they need a little bit of extra calories to help them catch up to a full term infant. We follow a formula given to us by our pediatrician which raises the calories on the breast milk to 22. My boss woke up and made me check every bottle. He doesn't mess around when it comes to eating. He's always been our little chunk. I'm so grateful that I pump enough breast milk to be able to make enough bottles to last the triplets 24 hours. With a little to spare. I finished in the nick of time because the triplets woke up ready to rumble.","Put a dollar in a 🫙 everytime I say breastmilk #spontaneoustriplets #momsoftiktok #dadsoftiktok #babiesoftiktok #trending #viral #tripletpregnancy #breastfeedingjourney #pumpingmom #busymom #makebottleswithme #dayinmylife #fourkids #tiredmom #breastfedbabieslike  Morning, guys.
